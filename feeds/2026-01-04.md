💬 I finally threw Claude at a few container processes that were spinning out of control, and I found a bitcoin miner that was running in one of the project templates I let Coolify install from their catalog. I don't blame them, but they should manage those updates too, but it was isolated (yay, containers) and it reminded me to figure out how to put resource limits per container group. 

Ironically, it was an exploit in the Umami image [https://umami.is](https://umami.is)

💬 Coolify will install/manage server updates, but there's no visible option to pull the latest image, which strikes me as a bug. 

I had Claude write a script that now runs on my four servers, which will find it if it comes back or any processes go rogue again. 

The good news is, I can resize my instance back down to the 4 CPU size and cut my bill down again. 

DO never quite worked in reverse like this, so I consider this annoying, but another win for Hetzner.

💬 I'm just trying to get my weirdo keyboard layout onto my remarkable paper pro.
It doesn't use the standard kmap but use a specific format (.qmap) optimized for embedded.

Thanks to [https://github.com/dps/remarkable-keywriter/issues/1#issuecomment-850917442](https://github.com/dps/remarkable-keywriter/issues/1#issuecomment-850917442) I know there is a tool that just does that, convert .kmap to .qmap.

Great! It's Qt, I used to use it quite a lot and love it before I started loving Go way more than c++.

💬 Let's do that.
All right, how can I install this tool? `apt-get`, nope, the ubuntu build didn't build this tool.
OK, let's get the source then.

Oh, now ubuntu has a new format for sources.list. It doesn't take me much to figure out how to update. Add `deb-src`, done.

`apt update`, `apt source qt…`.
qt-what? 199 options of sources to setup.

I display the list to see the pattern, it's `qt6-xxx-xxx` (different from the binary packages where it is `qt6xxxYzzz`).
I found it's in the tools subrepo.

OK
`apt source qt6-tools-dev`
It fails somehow because the source link gives a 404.

all right, let's get the original source!

💬 Before, Qt was such a breeze of use as a developer. The documentation was clear, easy to install.

Even if the C++ purists hated the `Qt` C++ and where only bragging about the stdlib and only boost as an alternative, I must say I loved the developer experience of Qt.

Now, just to find the link to the repo, it's not very clear.

I take one, clone it. On the documentation, it says to run the `init-repository` perl script to initialize correctly.
I try to run it, it fails as it's not there. I thought maybe it was a system script. 
No, reading the doc says it should be in the repo. It's not.

Ok, where is this repo where this script is supposed to be?
I look for it, find it, clone it.

Now I can run this script. Of course, it downloads the whole World and the Moon. So I stop it, and check the optinos. I can specify only a submodule.
All right, let's just get the `tools` submodule. It runs. Great.

💬 Ok, normally, a qmake and you should be good!

No.

Now it's cmake.
OK, I also know about this. I don't love it, but it makes pretty outputs.
Running it fails at some point, dependency of package Qt6 is not what is expected.

I'm already 30 mn in and I'm losing patience.

Trying a `./configure` on the top project for the form. It works, but I wonder, I thought cmake was made to kind of get rid of the `./configure` and all those m4 macros crap. Anyway, still doesn't work.

I'm just a stupid monkey typing on a keyboard at this point.

What is a little smarter than a monkey typing on a keyboard? AI, maybe?

💬 I paid for a Claude subscription at some point, on the advice of a friend. I paid for nothing since I used it 3 times in 5 months. I wanted to try some stuff with it, but, not enough time and interest.

Let's get those sweet $ back!

I had the stupid idea of writing this Qt tool in Go before I went in this crazy wild goose chase. But then, I tried to remember the tenet of the ancients who say: "rewriting a software will never be easy".

So I decided to refrain myself from doing it. And then, I went on this "trying to get the tool or build it" with the success that you know.

Yes the software seems simple enough ( [https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qttools.git/tree/src/kmap2qmap/main.cpp](https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qttools.git/tree/src/kmap2qmap/main.cpp) ), doesn't seem to have too many dependencies. Let's try it.

Claude, my dear unloved friend, please write me a Go version of this tool.

💬 "I'll fetch and analyze the C++ code, then create a Go version of this tool."

Great

Takes its time.

"I'm gonna generate a go.mod file for this project"

Uh, you really didn't need to, I would generate it myself. But ok.

"Now, let me write this LONG-ASS README file so it looks professional"

Nooo, please no, I don't want that.

"bla bla bla".

Ok, I can download the whole thing.

I don't download the go.mod because I don't trust it and it is trivial to generate. I check it, yup, it's using a very old version of  a dependency. Already a miss.

Let's RUUUUN this!

💬 One of the error is trivial. So trivial I wonder how Claude could generate that and be "OK seems good to me".

The second one is trickier and I try to understand what's up.
It seems Claude messed up some escape code and escaped the escape code one too-many. All right. I fix it and try to run it.

warnings everywhere.
There is a .qmap file, but I'm already suspicious. The README says that the qmap format is binary and starts with a magic number (0x514d4150).

hexdump shows otherwise
0x4150514d

Sounds fishy, or I just don't understand binary.

Anyway, I don't have such confidence on this crap now.

So I'm gonna do something that you should NEVER do in general, download the kmap2qmap very nicely compiled by the gentleman on the GitHub issue because I have other things to do and compare it with the Claude version, and I'm pretty sure this AI code generated qmap file is total crap.

For those who wonder why I'm such a Go fan, here is a good outlook on why.

I used to be a C++ dev, coding with Qt for a few years.

I just can't anymore, the level of complexity is so ludicrous. I don't want to lose so much time with complexity that should be reduced as much as possible.

Go is not perfect, but the tooling is so much smoother. I don't want to kill people after trying to compile an unknown Go project, for example.

And on top of that: AI IS SHIT.
Don't trust this crap.

💬 Working on a Go library that lets you create responsive web application UIs like these without using any React, Vue, Angular or any of that $%&$%&$. Only a generated and minified 9k JS runtime is delivered to the client, no hand-coded Javascript logic whatsoever.  Momentarily written in Go, might migrate it to ual later in the year, once ual gains sockets.

buggy and very beta, use at your own risk

Minty is a fresh, ultra-concise, type-safe HTML generation library for responsive Go web applications. It provides a fluent API for creating HTML components without traditional templates, offering compile-time safety and excellent IDE support.

The code examples are fresh, the documentation is very out of sync. Will be working on that soon.

💬 iOS 6 has to be the last iOS with well-designed UI. The UI is intentional and clear. It doesn't try to be anything more than that. It doesn't blur the lines between UI and user content. The UI is actually there as you need it rather than playing peek-a-boo with you. The visual affordances are very much appreciated. You know what is your stuff and what is a control or tool. And it makes *excellent* use of the very small real-estate available to it. It's refreshing to see.

💬 I wrote Zig bindings to quickjs-ng with 96% API coverage (~240 exported C decls) with unit tests, examples, and doc strings on all functions in less than 6 total hours with AI assistance. I never want to hear that AI isn't faster ever again. [https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-quickjs-ng](https://github.com/mitchellh/zig-quickjs-ng)

This isn't slop. I worked for those 6 hours. 

I was reviewing everything it outputted, updating my AGENTS.md to course correct future work, ensuring the output was idiomatic Zig, writing my own tests on the side to verify its work (while it worked), and more. My work was split across ~40 separate Amp threads (not one mega session, which doesn't work anyways unless you're orchestrating).

I have a ton of experience writing bindings to libraries for various languages, especially Zig. I have never achieved this much coverage in so little time with such high quality (e.g. test coverage). My usual approach is to get bind just-enough of the surface area to do my actual work and move on. This time I thought I'd draw the whole owl, because it's a new world. And I'm very happy with the result.

Anyone with experience writing bindings knows that you do some small surface area, then the rest of the coverage is annoying repetition. That's why I usually stopped. Well, LLMs/agents are really, really good at annoying repetition and pattern matching. So going from 5% API coverage to 95% is... cake. 

There is probably some corners that are kind of nasty still, but I've been re-reviewing every line of code manually and there is nothing major. Definitely some areas that can just use a nicer Zig interfaces over the C API, but that's about it.

I plan on writing a longer form blog showcasing my threads, but you can at least see the final AGENTS.md I produced in the linked repo.

I know for a fact that I could not have completed this amount of work in 6 hours fully manually (based on the experience that I've written something like 30+ bindings to C libraries in the past decade, probably more).
