💬 Chelsea, Manhattan 

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#SilentSunday](https://typo.social/tags/SilentSunday)

![A color, medium-angle photograph in portrait orientation, an interior shot from a high-floor office building in Chelsea, Manhattan.
The scene looks out through a large, industrial-style window toward a neighboring beige brick building. The window is divided into multiple panes by thick black metal frames, with two large white but aged roller shades partially drawn at the top, obscuring the upper left view. In the foreground, a vintage, cream-colored metal radiator cover sits on a classic light-wood parquet floor. A small section of exposed silver piping runs along the base of the window. Outside, the facade of the facing building dominates the view, featuring rows of large, uniform windows that reflect the overcast sky. Some of the windows across the way reveal glimpses of residential life, and several window-unit air conditioners are visible, tucked into the lower frames. To the far left, a sliver of a darker red-brick building provides a color contrast. The lighting is soft and muted, casting a neutral, slightly warm tone over the wooden floors and the weathered surfaces of the urban architecture.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/799/962/354/067/074/original/1db8617bfd82f93d.jpeg)

💬 Well, this chapter 24 on functions is definitely "a beast" as self-described in the opening sentence.   I've made it to the part of trying to call functions (not yet working).    Debating whether to try and power through after dinner or take a break until tomorrow.  

Aside: The "flow state" of coding in ed is far more intense than I would have anticipated.    Time disappears.

💬 Jersey City, as seen from Pier 45 in the West Village of Manhattan 🌅

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#SilentSunday](https://typo.social/tags/SilentSunday)

![A color, wide-angle, silhouette-style photograph that captures the skyline of Jersey City from the wooden boards of Pier 45 in Manhattan during sunset. The foreground is dominated by a dark wooden boardwalk on the right, bordered by a metallic railing with vertical posts that recede into the distance. The calm waters of the Hudson River fill the midground, reflecting the soft, pale yellow and orange glow of the twilight sky. The horizon is a stark black silhouette of dense skyscrapers, with the prominent 99 Hudson Street and Goldman Sachs Tower standing out against the fading light. The sky transitions from a deep, warm orange near the horizon to a pale, hazy cream color towards the top. Two birds are visible in flight; one is soaring in the upper left corner with its wings spread wide, while another smaller bird appears as a tiny speck in the upper right. The overall mood is serene and cinematic, utilizing high contrast to emphasize the architectural outlines of the city against the natural gradient of the setting sun. Two people walk along the far right edge of the pier, adding a sense of scale and quiet solitude to the urban landscape.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/800/359/241/671/650/original/3d7f8e2baf97daee.jpeg)

💬 I refused to join Bluesky and Threads because unlike Mastodon, they are operated by for-profit entities. 

Bluesky was founded by Jack Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter and advocated for Muskrat to buy it.

Threads is a Meta company.

No. Way. In. Hell. was I signing up.

I've never regretted joining Mastodon in the years since I left Twitter.

 I've had more meaningful engagement here than I ever did after spending over 12 years on the bird site.

💬 Chelsea - 7th Avenue at 23rd Street 🌮🔔

Axolotl out here representing for antifa salamanders. 🩷🦎

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#NoKings](https://typo.social/tags/NoKings) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color photograph captures the No Kings protest marching down Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. The foreground features several distinct individuals amidst a dense crowd of protesters. On the left, a large, bright-pink inflatable axolotl, a type of salamander, with prominent gills and large black eyes. The background provides context for the protest and the location. Protesters are holding various signs, one of which is clearly visible above the center of the crowd, a large red-bordered sign with a portrait of Donald Trump, and the text "TIME to go!". It mimics Time magazine cover. Other signs with the phrase "NO KINGS". The protest is flanked by tall Manhattan buildings; on the left, a low-rise, older brick building with fire escapes is visible above a Taco Bell sign, contrasting with the taller, more modern commercial buildings that line the right side of the avenue under a clear, bright sky.](https://fosstodon.org/media_proxy/115396362813796149/original)

💬 Added some more approaches including building JSON in PostgreSQL itself which, while sort of neat, is probably not very practical. Very fast, though.

One interesting thing is that django-rapid consistently outperforms django-bolt for me.

💬 [@adamghill](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill) [@farhanaliraza](https://mastodon.social/@farhanaliraza) I've used the JSON generated field in some Django project. 🤖

The database calculates the JSON and you only need to get it from the database. If you choose to have this field stored the calculation is made at write time and when you fetch the data you don't have any overhead, and everything is blazing fast. ⚡

I've shown this use case in my talk at DjangoCon US 2025, here the slide 👇

💬 This could be a case study on how design at Apple has gotten worse. Take iTunes/Music for Mac:

1. From Catalina on, full-height sidebars started eating into valuable toolbar real estate.
2. In Tahoe, not only to stupid big corner radii eats more into you usable area, they now allow the inspector sidebars to cut even more into toolbar space.
3. The volume & scrub controls are now an extra click away.

Just compare these newer UIs to [#iTunes](https://mastodon.social/tags/iTunes) from 2010. Full-width, excellent use of space.

💬 Who remembers 2007’s SimCity Societies, the SimCity spin-off that was so slow-paced that I read a book while playing it?

Minami Lane (PC, Mac, Linux, Xbox, Switch) is the same basic concept, but adorable and fun. Guided by Ema the Tanuki, you place traditional and modern houses, shops, and parks along Minami Lane, keeping the locals happy while completing missions such as revitalising an aging area or preparing for a music festival. Plus you can pet the cats.

It’s a great stress-free cosy management game that only takes four or five hours to complete (although it also has a sandbox mode where you can design your dream lane). I really enjoyed it.

![Screenshot of the game. An isometric lane in a cute cartoony style features a park, a few tiny houses with tiled roofs, and a ramen shop. There are some bikes parked up, and a person walking along the pavement. In the top left the interface shows the locals at 50% happiness, and the player having $9 in cash. In the bottom right the interface shows it’s 9:05am on day 4.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/803/541/612/573/130/original/f5b72fffc63d7e65.png)
