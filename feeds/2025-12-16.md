💬 I'm sharing this because it's quite a stark demonstration of what's possible using the latest frontier LLMs at the tail end of 2025

Is it a GOOD idea to churn out a 9,000 line direct port while watching Daniel Craig chew on the scenery? That's a whole other set of questions!

💬 Happy 35th to the original Commander Keen trilogy. 🎂🎉🥂

($15 back then is approximately $36 today.)

1. MAROONED ON MARS $15 
2. THE EARTH EXPLODES $15
3. KEEN MUST DIE! $15 

ORDER THE TRILOGY FOR $30 AND YOU GET: 
* THE "SECRET HINTS & TRICKS" SHEET

![ID Software. "We're In Demand!"

WE ARE A GROUP OF SOFTWARE ARTISTS WHOSE GOAL IS TO BRING COMMERCIAL QUALITY SOFTWARE TO THE PUBLIC AT SHAREWARE PRICES. 
OUR EFFORT IS ONLY POSSIBLE WITH YOUR SUPPORT. WITHOUT IT, WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS FINE SOFTWARE SO AFFORDABLE. 
THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUTURE OF THE GROWING SHAREWARE MARKET.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/720/290/040/708/245/original/3bc1bcd16bf3af6f.png)

![$15 per volume, or $30 for all three volumes!

Commander Keen is the first truly "commercial quality" game to be distributed
as shareware.  It features ultra high-speed smooth-scrolling EGA graphics and
superb sound effects.  The animation and scrolling is updated at nearly 40
frames per second, for comparison, motion picture quality cartoons are filmed
at only 24 frames per second.

The story of Commander Keen is epic, and in the style of the memorable
matinee serials, like Flash Gordon.  You play the role of Billy Blaze, eight
year-old kid genius who builds an interstellar ship when not working at home
on his college fast-track degree.  Among other household objects, Billy uses
his Nintendo joystick for flight control and his mom's vacuum cleaner
(heavily modified) for his ship's ion propulsion system (with pile height
adjustment).

At the hint of galactic trouble, Billy dons his brother's football helmet and
becomes "Commander Keen"─defender of Earth!  Ever on the side of justice,
fairness, and high calorie junk food, Keen dispenses justice with an iron hand.

Keen's first adventure takes you to Mars, where the Vorticon invasion force
is planning their conquest of Earth.  While Keen is exploring Mars the
Vorticons steal pieces of his ship and hide them within their cities.  Can
Keen recover all the pieces and repel the Vorticon invasion?  You'll explore
many dangerous cities, packed with diabolical traps and hideous creatures,
both of Martian and Vorticon origin.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/720/290/096/212/030/original/312200f62de97b7e.png)

💬 fediview.com continues to chug along, but the domain is up for renewal so now I'm trying to decide if it's worth keeping.

It generates a digest of your [#Fediverse](https://indieweb.social/tags/Fediverse) timeline based on a user-selected algorithm that you control and also sends an email summary every day.

Context:
- 1149 users
- 5 sent emails/day
- ~1 login/day

Tempted to keep it running, but move it to a subdomain of adamghill.com. Not sure having the TLD is doing much, but I personally still find the service itself useful.

💬 DjangoCon Europe 2025 in Dublin 🇮🇪

Looking back at DjangoCon Europe 2025, a few months later, this was a really good way to start the in-person conference season ✨

I was there as a speaker and a DSF board member: a talk on mentoring in Djangonaut Space, a short PyCon Italia mention during the lightning talks, and many good hallway conversations 🎉

💬 Working on a new code generator for ual 0.7.4 that generates Rust instead of Go.

So the ual compiler now has two new command line switches to indicate which backend you want to use:

--target go

--target rust

Experiments show that generated binaries using a Rust runtime and Rust as the IR result in binaries of about 400k on average for the bundled code examples.  That's significantly smaller than the Go-generated binaries somewhere between 1.8 Mb and 2.8 Mb.

I'm also adding a few other switches that control both language backends:

--release
--debug
--small

💬 Разработчики всё ещё путают JWT, JWKS, OAuth2 и OpenID Connect — разбираем на примерах. Часть 1

JWT, SSO, OAuth, OpenID Connect — названия знакомые каждому разработчику. Но стоит спросить: «Зачем в продакшене нужен JWKS?» или «Чем отличается OAuth2 от OpenID Connect?» — уверенность сразу исчезает. В этой статье мы разберём как устроен JWT и его подпись, зачем нужны access и refresh токены, что такое JWKS и в чём отличие OAuth от OpenID Connect. Вместо скучных стандартов и спецификаций протоколов в статье будет один наглядный образ на примере отелей и пропусков. Это позволит не только запомнить, но и прочувствовать на реальных примерах, избавиться от хаоса и путаницы в голове, когда речь заходит об аутентификации и авторизации. Цель статьи — не дать «рецепт внедрения», а дать возможность понять, как это работает внутри и «пощупать» эти темы на Go .

💬 GitHub Actions charging per build minute for *self-hosted-runners*? Shit's about to hit the fan lol

![You are receiving this email because your usage of GitHub Actions may be impacted by upcoming changes to GitHub Actions pricing.

What’s changing, when

On January 1, 2026, all customers will receive up to a 39% reduction in the net price of GitHub-hosted runners, depending on the machine type used.
On March 1, 2026, we are introducing a new $0.002 per-minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge that will apply to self-hosted runner usage. Any usage subject to this charge will count toward the minutes included in your plan.
No action is required on your part.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/730/529/264/943/481/original/47a19f22dc08d41d.png)

💬 “I think I know how to use passwords securely, so passkeys are annoying and nobody should use them.” is tech-speak for, “I don’t care about the online account security of other people.”, or more succinctly, “I don’t care about other people.”

People overestimate their competence and underestimate the cost of phishing and credential stuffing. Individuals having to learn to use password management software and be vigilant against phishing is an industry failure, not a personal success.

💬 Визуальный язык программирования в NebuLeet: эволюция и дизайн

Пару лет я в соло разрабатывал максимально нишевую игру "для программистов" ( NebuLeet ) на довольно нишевых технологиях (Go + ebitengine ), и вот теперь, после релиза, я хочу рассказать про одну из интересных особенностей этой игры - визуальном программировании логики игровых юнитов . Визуальный язык в игре прошёл несколько итераций развития, от неявных аргументов команд через стек, до чего-то типа регистровой модели, где у ячеек памяти есть имена, а команды принимают аргументы явно. Вас ждёт увлекательная околокомпиляторная/языковая статья с игровым применением. Всё-таки, языки программирования для игр - это ведь отдельный жанр.

![A color photograph taken along 10th Avenue facing north from the Lincoln Tunnel Expressway at sunset. The central focus is a bifurcating, elevated asphalt roadway. The foreground features a triangular median curb covered in gravel and dirt, dividing the road. Attached to a utility pole on this median is a traffic sign. The roadway itself is worn, with yellow dashed and solid lines marking the lanes. To the left, a concrete elevated highway ramp, supported by columns, runs parallel to the main road. The background is dominated by the city skyline, vibrant pink and magenta hues of the sunset sky, which casts a soft, warm light over the scene. The New York Times Tower is in the center of the frame. Other skyscrapers of varying heights and architectural styles fill the frame, many with illuminated windows.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/731/349/238/950/453/original/4e316438b415ded8.jpeg)

[#golang](https://tech.lgbt/tags/golang) developers love to tell you how wonderful net/http is to write your entire backend in, and are weirdly obsessed about binary size for something that will be shipped nowhere except EC2. But I have pages of fixed bugs that are directly attributable to the ways net/http makes you care about the order of parts of an HTTP response, and many, many more pages of allegedly reusable utility functions that all work slightly differently. Frameworks are awesome.

💬 deploying my second [#django](https://social.sixdegreesofohio.com/tags/django) app right now, onto [#DigitalOcean](https://social.sixdegreesofohio.com/tags/DigitalOcean) . 

Not effortless nor trivial, but not that bad at all, either.. and you can host these for $5/mo..

💬 Even pizza rat needs some variety. 🐀🥡

![A color, close-up photograph in square aspect ratio of a large, brown-gray rat with a long tail partially emerged from a discarded, white and red Chinese takeout food container resting on a dirty sidewalk. The rat's head and front portion of its body are inside the container as it eats. The takeout container is tipped open, showing the "Thank You" message printed in red lettering on the inside flap, and “Thank You, Yummy” are printed on the outside.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/731/789/885/688/338/original/bbb55c21a6583ac8.jpeg)

💬 Today in a work meeting I literally said "for those who come after" as a reason to document something well, and  a couple of co-workers apparently appreciated that.

💬 ✨ started tracking facet v. serde JSON performance

overall, right now, facet is 10x slower (requires 10x more instructions).

for select cases, with JIT, it's up to 10-20% faster. now we have the infra to track progress as JIT support increases :)
