💬 Lower Manhattan and the East River, as seen from beneath the Brooklyn Bridge ⛴️

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#Architecture](https://typo.social/tags/Architecture)

![A noir, wide-angle photograph that captures the dense skyline of Lower Manhattan as seen from atop a ferry in the East River. Taken from a low vantage point, the composition is framed on the right by the massive, weathered stone anchorage and dark underside of the Brooklyn Bridge. The choppy water in the foreground is rendered in deep, high-contrast tones, leading the eye toward the FDR Drive elevated highway that hugs the shoreline. The midday light creates sharp shadows and emphasizes the architectural textures of the city, ranging from the smooth glass of modern skyscrapers to the rhythmic patterns of older apartment blocks. Dominating the center-left of the frame is the soaring One World Trade Center, its geometric facets catching the light against a clear, pale sky. To its right stands the rippling, metallic facade of the Gehry Building, which provides a stark, liquid-like contrast to the rigid rectangles of the surrounding structures. The monochrome palette strips away the city’s usual color, focusing instead on the dramatic play between light and shadow, the immense scale of the suspension bridge, and the sheer verticality of the urban landscape.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/116/043/462/291/860/277/original/8cf6e4a9b36f3cfa.jpeg)

💬 Chinatown, Manhattan - Broadway

❄️🇨🇳🏙️

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Winter](https://typo.social/tags/Winter) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A silver tone, wide-angle photograph in landscape orientation that captures an atmospheric, high-angle scene above Broadway in the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan during a heavy snowstorm. The perspective looks down the center of the street, where a thick blanket of white snow covers the pavement and parked cars, showing only faint tire tracks. In the center of the frame, a lone figure with a dark umbrella crosses the street, emphasizing a sense of quiet isolation. Ornate, traditional Chinese decorative banners are strung across the air between buildings, their intricate patterns standing out against the dense, foggy white background where the street eventually disappears into the haze. The flanking architecture consists of tall, weathered urban buildings with visible fire escapes and storefronts adorned with Chinese signage. The left side features scaffolding and a few pedestrians huddled near the building edges, while the right side shows parked vehicles almost completely overtaken by snow. The lighting is soft and diffused, typical of a blizzard, creating a dreamlike, cinematic quality that blurs the line between a modern city and a historical memory. The overall composition is balanced and serene, highlighting the stillness that a major snowstorm brings to an otherwise bustling neighborhood.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/116/043/915/925/990/088/original/f0574e8133d154bc.jpeg)

Why isn’t there a separate warning, or a more accurate description to explain this alternate issue? No idea, because Apple does specify it in their support documentation. 📱💧👨🏻‍💻

💬 I learned about Scalingo for the first time this weekend, and had a mostly-successful deployment within an hour of making an account.

I think I can write a working django-simple-deploy plugin in a few days; I was able to do almost everything through the CLI.

This is exciting for two reasons: Scalingo has a 30-day free trial that doesn't require a CC, which is fantastic for people learning about deployment. Also, it's a non-US host, which is critical for many people now.

💬 C Django Rest Framework мы все дальше от Бога

Django Rest Framework (DRF) - чуть ли не единственный фреймворк для разработки REST на базисе Django. Мой нарратив о Django в прошлой статье заключался в том, что это неповоротливый монолит, который абсолютно не следует best practices и не стремится к ним. Если вдруг вы не задумывались о том, как связаны DRF и Django, то вас может быть немного это удивит - никак. Их делали совершенно разные люди, но каким-то образом они сошлись в общей концепции: игнор хороших практик, перегруженные классы и магия, превращающая разработчика в гадалку.

Does `Rule.__eq__` adequately check for duplicate rules? How can it account for `strict_slashes` behavior?" Even with all that, it missed the true cause completely, in two fresh sessions. So you can't even rely on being an expert to successfully use AI.

💬 This just shows how uncultured I am: took me a year to realize that Claude’s logo is a reference to Kurt Vonnegut’s classic Breakfast of Champions

![Excerpt From Breakfast of Champions

“This book is my fiftieth-birthday present to myself. I feel as though I am crossing the spine of a roof-having ascended one slope.
I am programmed at fifty to perform childishly—to insult “The Star-Spangled Banner,” to scrawl pictures of a Nazi flag and an asshole and a lot of other things with a felt-tipped pen. To give an idea of the maturity of my illustrations for this book, here is my picture of an asshole”

The new [#golang](https://fosstodon.org/tags/golang) release is here. Two of my favorite new features are:

1. "new" allows you to do "new(true)" to return a pointer to a true bool.
2. "go fix" is now an interface to the modernizer previously included in gopls. This will be easier to include in Makefiles and CI workflows.

💬 Der er en ny version af programmeringssproget Go, nærmere bestemt version 1.26.

* cgo har fået reduceret sit overhead med 30%, som resulterer i hurtigere C-kald
* Datastrukturen der ligger bag slices bliver fremover stack-allokeret, hvilket skulle føre til bedre ydelse.
* GreenTea-GC'en er nu aktiveret som standard.
* go fix-kommandoen er blevet omskrevet til at bruge Go Analyzer-frameworket. Så Go vil nu foreslå kodeforbedringer via en flok "moderizers"

💬 There's probably some stuff I'm misinterpreting in this and probably some really cool stuff that I missed - so really curious to hear what other Go devs think about this release!

Also - shoutout to the Go team for making a release that gets me excited. Not sure how I feel about being such a nerd that a programming language version release genuinely made my day - but they do such a good job at keeping things new and exciting while also maintaining backwards compatibility1 which is tough to do.

Back when I primarily worked in JS, I'd keep up with the Node and major package releases and every time it just felt like "oh wow, another set of breaking changes I need to go fix." Now it's "ooooo....shiny new toys to play with" and it feels awesome.

[#golang](https://polymaths.social/tags/golang)

  Okay...I admit I'm a little terrified of playing with the new garbage collector a bit. It seems fine on my local machine so far, but running it on low compute ARM seems less explored - but that's the only thing in this release that feels like that. Otherwise, I guarantee you I can version bump every Go program I've written to 1.26 without a single problem - and that's genuinely awesome. ↩︎

💬 Stonewall, a bar in NYC, is the birthplace of the modern LGBTQ+ movement. It is the only national monument to queer history this country has.

On January 21st the Trump administration forced the pride flag to be removed because it is neither a U.S. flag nor a POW flag.

I have witnessed people (myself included) visit Stonewall and bust into tears as they are overcome with pride and emotion over what those riots stood for.

For me personally this is the most upsetting thing that has occurred so far in this bigot’s time in office. 🏳️‍🌈😭

If you consider going to the US, whatever the reason, don’t, for your own safety.

If you consider organizing an event to the US for an international community, you’re putting people’s lives at risk.

If you want an English-speaking environment for an international event, pick Canada or the UK. Heck, even in Scandinavian countries everyone speaks English.

💬 With news that Discord is moving toward stricter age/ID verification and privacy concerns around this shift, I’m wondering whether Open Source communities like Python and Django should consider alternatives to Discord. 🤔

Platforms like Matrix or Zulip might better respect privacy and freedom of access.

What do you think about a migration away from Discord?

💬 TIL: all the cool kids are using prek instead of pre-commit, as its faster (Rust) and fully compatible with .pre-commit-config.yaml!

💬 San Jose, California -  Worldwide Developers Conference in 2019

Losing the full in-person conference is unfortunate because it was such a great way to network with others.

The upside is you don’t have to compete with hundreds of people for WiFi bandwidth to download the new beta releases. ⚙️🛜😱

![A color, wide-angle photograph in landscape orientation that captures a massive, brightly lit hall within the McEnery Convention Center, packed with hundreds of attendees following an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) keynote in 2019. Rows of long, light-colored wooden communal tables stretch deep into the background, almost entirely occupied by developers focused on their open laptops. Many individuals are leaning forward or resting their heads in their hands as they wait for new beta software releases to download. A sea of people in casual attire fills the space, creating a dense mosaic of tech enthusiasts engaged in the same post-keynote ritual. In the foreground, the focus is on several developers seated at a table, their screens displaying various coding environments and system interfaces. One individual on the left wears a bright cyan WWDC19 t-shirt, while others have scattered snacks, water bottles, and tangled charging cables across the wooden surface. The architecture of the hall features large white square pillars and a distant mezzanine level where more crowds are visible, adding to the sense of scale. The lighting is soft and even, reflecting off the floor and the numerous aluminum laptop lids.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/116/048/989/810/889/245/original/76a2c4c717ec3d60.jpeg)

💬 Очередные результаты полувайбкодинга.

Запилил себе десктопный клиент для Meshtastic.

Если вдруг кому-то тоже веб-клиент кажется неюзабельным - можно брать тут:

P.S. В данный момент работает только через подключение по IP. Дизайн подразумевает возможность разработки serial и bluetooth транспортов, но они не реализованы.

💬 Photographers! I have a question. If you were to travel with your fancy camera, and only take one lens with you, what would you bring?

I'm leaving Monday on a trip, and I'm considering narrowing it down to one lens. For context, I have a Canon R5 mirrorless, and a pretty decent selection of lenses. I'm interested in what you'd being regardless of brand though.

Boosts appreciated.
