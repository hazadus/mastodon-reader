💬 This is mere weeks after Bitcoin hit a new ATH of ~$126,000 in October. Take into consideration that Coinbase allows customers to borrow USD Coin (a fiat backed stable coin) using their Bitcoin as collateral. The company was overjoyed to announce on October 1st that they had reached $1 billion of these loan originations.

This sort of unregulated BS is going to have an overaching negative impact on many parts of the financial markets, and yet here we are making it only more easy to dig deeper. 👨🏻‍💻

💬 Runestone for iPhone and iPad (and Vision Pro 😮) by [@simonbs](https://mastodon.social/@simonbs) is running a Black Friday sale to unlock the pro features of the app for a one time charge of $5.

You won’t find a better looking or more fully featured text/code editor available on mobile. All of the code and blog posts I write for my website happen in this app with Working Copy providing Runestone access to my git repo.

It’s also one of the best examples of Liquid Glass implemented right

💬 Out of curiosity I decided to try and run the numbers on how much Netflix you can watch for the energy cost of a ChatGPT prompt

As far as I can tell it's between 5.1 and 10.2 seconds, depending on which end of the 2019 IEA Netflix energy usage estimate you use

[https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/29/chatgpt-netflix/](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/29/chatgpt-netflix/)

![In June 2025 Sam Altman claimed about ChatGPT that "the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours".

In March 2020 George Kamiya of the International Energy Agency estimated that "streaming a Netflix video in 2019 typically consumed 0.12-0.24kWh of electricity per hour" - that's 240 watt-hours per hour at the higher end.

Assuming that higher end, a ChatGPT prompt by Sam Altman's estimate uses:

0.34 Wh / (240 Wh / 3600 seconds) = 5.1 seconds of Netflix

Or double that, 10.2 seconds, if you take the lower end of the Netflix estimate instead.

I'm always interested in anything that can help contextualize a number like "0.34 watt-hours" - I think this comparison to Netflix is a neat way of doing that.

This is evidently not the whole story with regards to AI energy usage - training costs, data center buildout costs and the ongoing fierce competition between the providers all add up to a very significant carbon footprint for the AI industry as a whole.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/630/580/089/191/202/original/cacf3484064616be.png)

💬 You don’t need to understand trans issues in order to support the community. You may genuinely disagree with certain things, but the path “just asking questions” can quickly lead you down is not helpful. I see so many cis men do this repeatedly on fedi, and they represent the polar opposite of masculinity. If you see a marginalized group being weaponized and demonized your default response should always be protection. Behave in such a way that women wouldn’t cross the street to avoid you. 🏳️‍⚧️👨🏻‍💻

![A color, low-angle photograph that captures the massive, white structural spine and cables of the High Roller Wheel 🎡 along The Strip in Las Vegas. It is silhouetted against a brilliant and cloudless deep blue sky. The wheel dominates the frame, curving sharply upward from the bottom left toward the upper right from a perspective that emphasizes its immense scale. A prominent, dark-tinted passenger gondola, clearly marked with the purple and white "HIGH ROLLER" logo, is visible in the foreground attached to the main support structure on the right.

💬 Young's "Abolishing Fossil Fuels: Lessons From Movements That Won" ([https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9798887440330](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9798887440330)) explores how various social justice movements—women's suffrage, labor rights, race rights, etc.—won battles in the US. I really want a similar book that explores how drugs, pollution, car safety, the stock market, etc. came to be regulated (written for an interested layperson rather than to impress fellow academics). I think it would teach us a lot about how to handle AI.

I haven't been able to get a proper night's sleep in over a week and everything seems impossible again.

💬 I picked up a Home Assistant Green to replace my broken RPi3 Home Assistant box last holiday season. After a year of using it, it's been stable and an excellent addition to my [#homelab](https://mastodon.social/tags/homelab) 

We had to replace our washing machine this year, and it has Home Assistant integration, which is pretty cool. I haven't quite figured out what to do with this data, but I'm debating flashing something on our TV or changing one of the bulbs' colors so that I see it.

These boxes contain the following text: "AI NONSENSE.", three boxes labeled "SPONSORED RESULT", a box labeled "PEOPLE ALSO ASK", and a box labeled "VIEW PRODUCTS". Below the "VIEW PRODUCTS" box are four smaller, square boxes with a small icon of a shopping cart in each. 

The entire image is drawn in a simple, cartoonish style with thin black lines and a minimal color palette of purple, blue, and white.

💬 20 years ago an old CRT monitor displaying the blue screen of death to represent a Windows PC on the network was a funny, if petty, reference that users understood. The first time this icon was seen on stage during a keynote Steve Jobs said, “if you have an old Windows PC *yuck* up in the attic you can connect to it over the network for file sharing.” I imagine young people today have zero understanding of this reference, and it should be updated to better reflect modern computing. 👨🏻‍💻

💬 [@webology](https://mastodon.social/@webology) [@ehmatthes](https://fosstodon.org/@ehmatthes) [@wsvincent](https://fosstodon.org/@wsvincent) Per usual, I don't have a defined plan, but I do have some thoughts which are shaping some ideas. 😆

1. creating a bog-standard Django application from scratch is too complicated
2. the built-in startproject/startapp is not opinionated enough (and changing it is too fraught)
3. the quicker from 0 to functioning app, the better for onboarding

There is a middle ground between the built-in startproject/startapp and most other starter projects I think.
