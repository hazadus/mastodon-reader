This paints a clearer picture of the evolution of the two projects and API coverage over the last 12 months. The goal is to bring Olu to api parity with rserv 0.5.3 targeting completion sometime between March and June 2026.

💬 🚢 Just released Django Keel – a production-ready Django starter.

For 10+ years I maintained a popular Django cookiecutter template used across client projects and FOSS. Django Keel is all those lessons distilled into something cleaner and more modern.

Tired of spending 2 days on boilerplate every time? Me too.

Not a toy. Not a tutorial. Just the boring defaults that actually work in production.

💬 Page, Arizona - November 6th, 2021

🏜️🎈

[#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![This is a close-up, low-angle photograph of a hot air balloon illuminated from within at night, showing a vibrant and intricate design on its envelope. The pattern is a complex, psychedelic, deep fractal design, primarily in glowing shades of fiery orange, red, and yellow against a dark, cool-toned background of deep indigo and violet. The fractal pattern features countless swirling, self-similar spirals that seem to climb and cascade down the fabric of the balloon. The internal illumination makes the pattern appear to pulse and glow intensely against the dark night sky, drawing attention to the fine, delicate details of the artwork. The perspective captures a significant portion of the balloon's upper hemisphere, emphasizing its massive, curved form and the fabric's texture where the light shines through. The structure is defined by dark, vertical seams running down the balloon. A small portion of the darker material near the base is visible at the very bottom. The contrasting warmth of the fractal pattern and the cool, dark background create a stunning visual effect.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/409/531/172/843/779/original/e0b346bfde03464f.jpeg)

💬 I'm confused.

PEP 684 (A per Interpreter GIL), is supposed to mean that if run code in separate Python sub interpreters at same time, I should be able to bypass 1 CPU restriction.

This should be easy to test in mod_wsgi since it can delegate URLs to WSGI app instances in different sub interpreters of one process.

I believe I have config right, and URLs return correct sub interpreter name, but still stuck at 1 CPU when benchmark across URLs delegated to the different sub interpreters.

💬 Could any web devs here who are using [#django](https://hachyderm.io/tags/django) point me in the right direction on this?

I have a multi-tenant blog app where the templates for a given blog are found in subdirectories of `<app>/templates`. For non-class-based-views, I can pull the tenant from the request and use that to build the template path for `render()`.

I'm now trying to add some generic class-based-views, and the template loading insists on a template resolution scheme that is independent of a request object, so I am struggling to figure out how to isolate templates by tenant.

Any thoughts or tips would be very appreciated.

💬 Why WordPress Still Reigns in 2025: A Community-Centered Perspective

In 2025, WordPress continues to be the backbone of accessible, customizable web publishing—especially for community organizations, libraries, and small businesses. Built on a robust open-source database, WordPress empowers users to organize content intuitively through categories and tags. Categories help group broader topics like “Digital Literacy” or “Community Programming,” while tags such as [#Python](https://donwatkins.info/tag/python/), [#GoLang](https://donwatkins.info/tag/golang/), or [#JavaScript](https://donwatkins.info/tag/javascript/) allow for granular indexing and discovery.

WordPress in Our Library System

In the [Chautauqua-Cattaraugus Library System](https://cclsny.org/), WordPress has become a cornerstone of digital outreach. Each member library—from rural branches to urban hubs—can maintain its own affordable, mobile-friendly website. These sites are tailored to local needs, whether that means promoting youth programming, sharing health resources, or hosting community events. With responsive themes and accessibility plugins, WordPress ensures that every visitor—on desktop or mobile—can engage with ease.

Beyond Libraries: WordPress for Culture and Commerce

WordPress isn’t just for nonprofits. It powers millions of sites across industries, including cultural institutions, local businesses, and grassroots movements. The [WordPress Showcase](https://wordpress.org/showcase/tag/culture/) highlights how diverse communities use the platform to tell their stories, sell products, and organize for change.

Installation Made Easy—Even for Linux Users

Linux users can install WordPress on distributions like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian with minimal fuss. Prefer a pre-configured solution? [Turnkey Linux](https://www.turnkeylinux.org/wordpress) offers a ready-to-deploy WordPress virtual machine. You can grab the [ISO](https://www.turnkeylinux.org/download?file=turnkey-wordpress-18.2-bookworm-amd64.iso) and launch it in your favorite virtualization environment. The source code for their WordPress build is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/turnkeylinux-apps/wordpress).

Mobile Blogging for the On-the-Go Creator

In today’s mobile-first world, WordPress keeps pace with a sleek [mobile app](https://wordpress.org/mobile/) for iOS and Android. Whether you’re documenting a community event or updating your blog from the road, publishing is just a tap away.

Learn, Host, and Grow

New to WordPress? The [official documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/) is a treasure trove of tutorials, guides, and community wisdom. For hosting, WordPress recommends several [commercial providers](https://wordpress.org/hosting/) that balance performance with affordability.

If you’re in education or just starting out, platforms like [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) and [Edublogs](https://edublogs.org/) offer free sites with built-in support—though plugin options may be limited.

Join the Open Source Movement

WordPress thrives because of its vibrant global community. Developers, designers, educators, and advocates contribute daily to its evolution. The core source code is open and available [on GitHub](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress), and if you’re ready to dive in, [join the community](https://make.wordpress.org/) and help shape the future of the web.

Whether you’re building a site for a local library, launching a community initiative, or simply blogging your journey, WordPress remains one of the most inclusive, flexible, and empowering platforms available. It’s more than just a CMS—it’s a tool for connection.

💬 It's neat to see them encourage developers to add ARIA tags to pages though, an "agent" can be thought of as effectively another form of assistive technology

![There was one other detail in the announcement post that caught my eye:

    Website owners can also add ARIA tags to improve how ChatGPT agent works for their websites in Atlas.

Which links to this:

    ChatGPT Atlas uses ARIA tags---the same labels and roles that support screen readers---to interpret page structure and interactive elements. To improve compatibility, follow WAI-ARIA best practices by adding descriptive roles, labels, and states to interactive elements like buttons, menus, and forms. This helps ChatGPT recognize what each element does and interact with your site more accurately.

A neat reminder that AI "agents" share many of the characteristics of assistive technologies, and benefit from the same affordances.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/413/653/495/024/473/original/ea6c6a43eca2c3f0.png)

The image is dominated by the dense concentration of skyscrapers and buildings in Midtown, with the Empire State Building prominently positioned on the right side of the frame. The low angle of the sun, filtered by clouds, bathes the scene in a warm, golden light, creating long shadows and sharply highlighting the texture of the buildings. In the foreground and middle ground, a mix of commercial and residential architecture is visible, ranging from historic brownstones to modern towers. The sky above is partially cloudy, with dramatic, wispy clouds catching the sunlight in shades of orange, pink, and gray. The view extends far into the distance, offering a panorama of Lower Manhattan and the surrounding boroughs. The financial district's towers, including One World Trade Center, are visible in the center-left background, silhouetted against the bright horizon. The Hudson River and the waterways surrounding the island can be seen as shimmering bands in the far distance, and Jersey City, New Jersey is visible through a light haze on the far right.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/413/693/797/667/543/original/eae1ae32679aa85f.jpeg)

The same could be true for various third party websites that don't have public APIs if I'd want to ignore their content outside what we are posting.

💬 So Graham Platner, who has been pushed as the great progressive hope in the Democratic primary for Senate in Maine next year, has had the following things come out about him in the past few days:

* When asked for a list of current Senators he admires, named Josh Hawley, MAGA Republican of Missouri
* In reddit comments on his now-unearthed account, claimed he would have volunteered to fight both the US' genocidal wars against Native Americans, and the wars to establish "banana republics" in Central America
* Was found to have made comments, when he was a bartender, blaming women for their own sexual assaults (basically, "she got drunk, what did she expect" type stuff)
* Was found to have made racist "jokes" based on stereotypes about Black people
* Was found to have a Totenkopf, a literal actual factual Nazi symbol, tattooed on his chest that he has never sought to have removed or covered up

This is on top of what we already knew, which was that after serving multiple tours in Iraq, in *2018* he signed on as a mercenary with Blackwater and went to Afghanistan.

Currently on other social media sites, prominent progressive/leftist accounts are scolding "liberals" for being too mean to Platner, and implying that anyone who has a problem with him must be a paid shill of the Democratic Party "establishment" or of AIPAC (or both). 

Even Bernie Sanders is scrambling to try to deflect and defend rather than just admit he was wrong about Platner. Emergency supplies of "boys will be boys" are being flown in and people who ought to know better are confidently lecturing "goody two-shoes liberals" (actual quote from one podcaster who's getting ratio'd right now) on how every man under 40 is a Nazi and a misogynist nowadays, and so they claim we just have to accept that in our candidates.

So, look. Black voters sounded the alarm on this guy day one.

Just like they sounded the alarm on John Fetterman.

Just like they sounded the alarm on Tulsi Gabbard.

If we would all just listen, we likely wouldn't be in this mess to begin with.

If you live in Maine, your best hope to unseat Susan Collins is almost certainly Janet Mills, who has decent enough policy stances, is younger than Bernie Sanders, and already ran and WON multiple statewide elections there and so is much less likely to have a whole string of awful opposition research get dumped in public for the first time during this election.

💬 The best comment I've seen on this whole thing so far was someone saying Platner actually could easily defeat Susan Collins... if he ran as a Republican. On that side of the aisle, being a racist misogynist Nazi Blackwater mercenary is a strength.

On our side, though, it should be disqualifying.
