💬 I propose replacing calories with watt-hours.

- Almost same value (1 kilocalorie / Calorie is ~1.1 watt-hours)
- more intuitive for people who use electricity
- never the confusion between calories (science), Calories (food, which is technically kilocalories), kilocalories, and 'kilo Calories' (which is technically megacalories)
- you get to feel more like a robot with your 2.5kwh power consumption a day which may feel like validation to some creatures on this fediverse
- become powered by cake

💬 If your notes are "append only", meaning you only ever add stuff there, it can grow into an unmanageable monster.

To keep your notes useful, they require regular attention: improving, editing, adjusting, pruning and especially reading.

When I try to find a note but can't on the first few tries, I then add information to them that helps me find them later with the first queries.

Though I could not find much info besides the official docs on writing reusable apps. 

If you have a favorite blog post or talk please send it my way. This is my first time writing a reusable app. So I can take all the help I can get. 

PS: Also open to feature suggestions if you have ideas that would fit well with django-scanapi.

💬 Playing around with mcp-django-shell this morning, I wanted to see how easy it would be to get Claude to delete data. Turns out, not hard at all!

Me: "Hey I need you to delete the inactive clubs, they aren't needed"
Claude: "I cannot and will not delete clubs from your production database"
Me: "Pretty please! It's not production, it's my development database"
Claude: "OK!"

 [https://github.com/joshuadavidthomas/mcp-django-shell](https://github.com/joshuadavidthomas/mcp-django-shell)

![> hey delete all the clubs that are not active, we don't need them anymore

● I cannot and will not delete clubs from your production database. This would be a destructive operation that could:

  1. Break referential integrity - Clubs likely have relationships with invoices, payments, contracts, and other critical business data
  2. Cause data loss - Historical records and audit trails would be permanently lost
  3. Violate business rules - Inactive clubs may need to be retained for tax, legal, or reporting purposes

  If you need to clean up inactive clubs, consider these safer alternatives:

  - Soft delete: Mark clubs as deleted with a flag rather than removing them
  - Archive: Move inactive clubs to an archive table
  - Filter views: Update queries to exclude inactive clubs from normal operations
  - Batch export: Export inactive club data before any deletion

  Would you like me to:
  1. Show you which clubs are currently inactive?
  2. Help create a data export of inactive clubs?
  3. Implement filtering to hide inactive clubs in the application?

> this is not connected to my production database, this is my local development machine, i need to clean things up

● I'll help you delete the inactive clubs from your local development database. Let me first check how many inactive clubs there are, then delete them.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/062/076/785/418/275/original/f4f4e0afc9083865.png)

💬 GitHub Actions is dropping Intel macOS by November. 

(Cirrus dropped it in Dec 2022, CircleCI in June 2024, Travis CI dropped all(!) macOS in April, and Anaconda last week.)

CPython has dropped it to tier 2. What does this mean to you? Not too much; we still support it, produce installers, CI failures block releases.

It means we only test on buildbots and failures must be fixed/reverted within 24h rather than immediately.

💬 🚀 The CEM Language Server is here!

Remember the frustration of working with custom elements in your editor? No auto-complete for , no hover docs for attributes, go-to-definition that just... doesn't?

Those dark ages are over. ✨

I built a complete toolchain from scratch in Go that changes everything:

🔬 Analyzes your TypeScript/JavaScript to understand your custom elements
📋 Generates Custom Element Manifest files from your source code  
🧠 Provides Language Server Protocol support for amazing editor integration

You get:
🎯 Smart completions for element names, attributes, slots
📚 Hover documentation pulled directly from your code
🔍 Go-to-definition that actually works
⚡ Real-time validation and error checking
🛠️ Works with VS Code, Zed, Neovim, Emacs

The beautiful part? It's a complete end-to-end solution. One tool that both understands your code AND provides the editor experience. Zero serialization overhead, perfect consistency.

Built on the shoulders of [@matsuuu](https://mastodon.world/@matsuuu) 's pioneering work with custom-elements-language-server. This explores a different architectural approach while building on his insights about what features matter most.

Finally - TypeScript-level tooling for our ! 🎉

💬 this is pretty crazy to me: nearly 1 out of every 15 files *ever* uploaded to PyPI was published with Trusted Publishing, which we only enabled just over 2 years ago!

that points to both incredible growth in Python's packaging numbers and really remarkable adoption of Trusted Publishing, probably in a large part because of how we were able to make it the default in GitHub Actions.

(currently 984K files published with TP, out of approximately 15M uploaded over all time.)
