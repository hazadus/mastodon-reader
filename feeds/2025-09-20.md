💬 I'm looking for US/North America remote work and would love any boosts!

I'm a product designer who's made accessible design systems, trained people in human-centered design, managed teams, and still knows how to do the work. I've worked with governments, EV tech, and more.

I also wrote a book called We Need to Talk (Rosenfeld, 2025), so I'm good with nearly any kind of tricky conversation.

💬 :no_nazi: via [@davidcelis](https://xoxo.zone/@davidcelis)

｢ I get that doing so is an incredibly difficult decision to make, but people have had years to distance themselves from this man. But they don’t, so Ruby and Rails continue to be directed by far-right sympathizers like DHH and Tobi Lütke (and their money). And all of this is allowed because Ruby and Rails have a code of conduct that purposefully falls prey to the paradox of tolerance ｣

💬 zenas - z80 assembler

zenas gains basic C-style macros. The .MACRO_STYLE directive works for the most basic cases passing simple parameters.

Notice the very subtle difference between these two most basic code examples. One of them uses a constant value, the other uses a variable parameter to perform an operation.

Up next I'm working on call-block style (not inline) function calls, juggling multiple parameters, return values and other nice things on the drawing board. Possibly the most important external tool is the z88dk library importer, which I'm still drafting on the back of my mind.

💬 YouTube is annoying. We ran into 153 errors at DjangoCon US because of some changes YouTube were A/B testing. 

Today, I noticed they rolled it out and all of our video embeds on [https://djangotv.com](https://djangotv.com) were causing 153s until I deployed the latest version of lite-youtube-embed. 

If anyone sees a feature or bug and you want to report it, I track them on [https://github.com/django-news/djangotv-roadmap/issues](https://github.com/django-news/djangotv-roadmap/issues) and eventually get around to them.

💬 [@webology](https://mastodon.social/@webology) [@josh](https://social.joshthomas.dev/@josh) [@browniebroke](https://fosstodon.org/@browniebroke) The thing that gave me pause with PyPI API was this note that the `releases` key was  deprecated for [https://docs.pypi.org/api/json/](https://docs.pypi.org/api/json/) — that's basically exactly what I was looking for, but not if it's going to go away at some point.

[https://docs.pypi.org/api/index-api/](https://docs.pypi.org/api/index-api/) is doable although the data seems a little funkier, i.e. I was expecting a `version` key in the file data. I guess I can just parse the filename, though. 🤷

💬 [#Django](https://growers.social/tags/Django) is quite a thing, I have to say. 

As a callow youth of 42 or thereabouts, with a body that was increasingly protesting the days I was forcing it to endure driving dumptrucks, and a long tail of computer geekery along with still-undiagnosed ADHD that served as a fine dead weight on my brain through this whole process, I did a deep dive into GNU/Linux as well as Python. 

Not sure why I decided to go all in on Python and spend what felt like months of incredible pain cramming all the concepts into my head as it screeeeamed to go play Half Life or something, but I did. More ADHD I suppose, for all my fecklessness I have been known to ohhhhhhh hyperfocus (that's me reading more deeply about it at some point).

Anyways I got through the Python fundamentals, not absolutely everything and it was still the age of Python 2, but I understood what all the things were, the types of data available, etc, though I had not yet done the [woodshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodshedding), it was still kinda torturous to actually type code in, cause that's how my brain was before Vyvanse. It was not that interested in new things. But my back and my knees were holding a gun to my brain's head, with a wild and kinda desperate look in their eyes that made both the brain and I very nervous, so I told the brain to do what they said.

Anyways, in this form I took up Django, did the tutorials, typing along with everything, and I liken this period to the few months during 2020-2021 where I spent hours every day grinding on piano scales, until I could play all twelve with both hands through two octaves on a reasonable meter. Both were self-inflicted hells with a payoff.

And since I abused Django as my coding woodshed, working on a few sites and such but mostly just forcing myself to Do The Thing so I could eventually Get A Job, I really did miss what a goddam marvel it is. 

Meantime, those who've been reading this account a long time know the story, got on making cartoons as Linux IT, deployed a huge render farm, and eventually, used a bit of Python to script my job away, and also used Django to create a quick-and-dirty control interface for the render blades, which were all running Ubuntu on bare metal. 

Eventually I was just a pure Python dev at Mikros Animation for a little while, until this whole fascism and AI austerity thing swept my team out to sea. Somewhere in there, Python and coding in general became fun. 

And that brings us to this morning, when I decided I'm sick of waiting to find the Grocery List app of my dreams and just build the damn thing cause this is not, you know, rocker surgery. FastAPI was momentarily considered, but my investigations seemed to suggest that its main raison d'aitre was async, and Django has async at home, while I already understand MVC and Django's overall schtick, so it was an easy choice.

But it was revisiting the [Overview](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/intro/overview/), and the demo of how things work using the Python console, that really was a moment of revelation. Now that I have not just the raw language but a small degree of fluency and experience in how complex big projects can very quickly get, I am seeing the forest for the trees in this demo, and how much is just done for you. 

Batteries Included indeed. Nicely done, [@django](https://fosstodon.org/@django)

![Amazonians,

We've reviewed the Presidential Proclamation on H-1B visas that was released today and are actively working to gain greater clarity. Here's what you need to know right now: The proclamation creates a travel restriction starting September 21, 2025, at 12:01 a.m. EDT (9:01 p.m. PDT tomorrow). After this deadline, individuals cannot enter the U.S. on H-1B status without an additional $100,000 payment associated with their petition. Recommended actions for you to take:

If you have H-1B status and are in the U.S.: Stay in the country for now, even if you have travel planned for the immediate future. We will continue to provide updates as more details are available.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/237/446/417/588/833/original/7f9f22457423cfad.jpeg)

![If you have H-4 dependent status: We also recommend you remain in the U.S., though the proclamation doesn't specifically mention H-4 dependents.

If you have H-1B or H-4 status and are outside the U.S.: Try to return before tomorrow's deadline if possible. We realize this is short notice but returning soon is advisable and you should make every effort possible to clear U.S. customs before 12:00 a.m. EDT (9:00 p.m. PDT) on Sunday, September 21, 2025.

At this time, if you have an H1-B or H-4 status and are unable to return before the deadline, we advise that you do not attempt to enter the U.S. until further guidance is provided.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/237/446/526/891/865/original/ec9a81041d01084e.png)

If we go back a year, Django was bigger than FastAPI. Skip forward to today, and it's 10x to 12x bigger. Python even grew 26% over last year (last stat was from June), but Django has plateaued in downloads. 

We can overcome this, but we have to take it seriously, and start telling people what Django can do (and update our docs.)

💬 [@adamghill](https://indieweb.social/@adamghill) this is exactly what [@wsvincent](https://fosstodon.org/@wsvincent) says too. I’d imagine the key points should be easily agreeable. Getting it done is something else, but that is the point of the work group no?

💬 I have now interviewed over a dozen people about shutting down research projects and software projects. All but two have been deliberate closures (long enough timescale to reflect and correct course while winding down). I would be grateful if people who have been through abrupt closure (little or no warning, very short timescale) would share their experiences. I'm gvwilson@third-bit.com and all interviews will be confidential. Thanks in advance - Greg

💬 I can't believe we used to just raw dog code changes without CI (when I started my career, this was the norm, I'm old enough to remember unfortunately). The Ghostty CI catches things constantly that we'd never be able to reasonably manually or locally find.

💬 Since [#PyConUK](https://mastodon.social/tags/PyConUK) has its AV on point, my keynote yesterday is already live on YouTube.

I don't want to say/spoil anything about it, except that it's the first real keynote I've ever written, it encompasses almost 20 years of writing Python, the feedback has been phenomenal, and that you should watch it (and come to the next PyCon UK): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDvwRpl9erE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDvwRpl9erE)
