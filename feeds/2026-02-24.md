💬 Sadio Mane, The Liverpool Star from Senegal (earning approximately 10.2 million dollars annually),has given the world a lesson in modesty after some fans spotted him carrying a cracked Iphone.His response is legendary:
"Why would I want ten Ferraris, 20 diamond watches and two jet planes? What would that do for the world? I starved, I worked in the fields, I played barefoot, and I didn't go to school. Now I can help people. I prefer to build schools and give poor people food or clothing. I have built schools [and] a stadium; we provide clothes, shoes, and food for people in extreme poverty. In addition, I give 70 euros per month to all people from a very poor Senegalese region in order to contribute to their family economy. I do not need to display luxury cars, luxury homes, trips, and even planes. I prefer that my people receive a little of what life has given me," Mane said.

💬 Most security reports could be a couple sentences and a small code snippet, and would be better for it. I hate that every report is written as if it were a blog post about their finding and how it's the greatest disaster of all time. Write as if you're having a dialog with a knowledgeable maintainer, wait for questions to elaborate if needed. LLMs have not made this better either.

💬 Django's query string tag (from v5.1) is a good example of a maintenance slow-bleed.

It **seems** simple but, over the space of users, has so many possible (i.e. actual) applications that there's a long stream of requests and revisions needed.

When folks are like "Why can't we **just** add feature…?" it's because they simply don't see what **just** adding that feature entails.

💬 Serious question: as a user (not as a developer!), have you ever seen substantial improvement in a piece of a software from a ground-up rewrite?

In other words, have you ever used (but not co-developed) something where the developer(s) decided on stopping evolutionary work and instead embarked on a substantial rewrite, and the outcome as you saw it firsthand was a real improvement?

If so, please state your example. Please stick to personal experience, rather than hearsay. Thanks!

💬 I often see people posting Nikita Gill poems here, so let me share a little story.

Her poem ‘For Her’ is one of my favourites, and I told her that it can always bring me to tears, and I realise she didn’t have women like me in mind when she wrote it (as I’m trans), but I hope she didn’t mind me seeing myself in it and sharing the experience.

Her reply: “I wrote this for all women, so this poem is absolutely for you!” 🥹

![A photo of a poem in a book:

For Her

Every day
I thank the girl in me
that believed my life
could still be
something magical
even when the darkness
was enough to chew her up,
and spit her out
even when the ledge
was close enough
for her to end it all.

She still chose life.
And I owe it to her
to make something incredible
of myself.

On the days I succeed
I put my hand on my heart
and whisper to her
‘This is for you.’](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/116/125/062/966/021/189/original/b1f4546afd1f08ba.jpg)

💬 Ended Monday and welcomed Tuesday after a swim with Vince Guaraldi Trio the debut studio album by American jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi (credited to the Vince Guaraldi Trio), released in the US by Fantasy Records in September 1956.

Billboard wrote a positive review, “Altho [sic] sales are unlikely to be spectacular, this is one of the pleasant surprises of the month. Guaraldi is a young San Francisco pianist who has been getting rave notices with the Woody Herman band. Evidence here says he’s a tasteful, authoritative and facile modernist, and that he swings. Further, he has a sense of humor. Guitarist Eddie Duran and bassist Dean Reilly are worthy colleagues. Try their version of John Lewis' 'Django' for a real delight.” - Wikipedia

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#Architecture](https://typo.social/tags/Architecture)

![A color, wide-angle photograph in square aspect ratio that captures a snowy winter day along Eighth Avenue in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. The scene features a row of classic multi-story brick apartment buildings. In the foreground, a snow-dusted deciduous tree stands centered, its intricate, bare branches heavily coated in white, creating a stark contrast against the dark red and grey facades behind it. The ground is covered in a thick layer of slushy snow, and individual heavy snowflakes are visible falling through the air, giving the scene a quiet, muffled atmosphere despite the urban setting. The street level of the buildings is occupied by a series of storefronts, including a Chipotle Mexican Grill with its signature signage on the right and a Dig Inn with a pale mint-green facade in the center. To the left, a portion of a local market is visible. Above the shops, the residential floors feature traditional black metal fire escapes zigzagging up the red brick walls, with snow accumulating on every horizontal railing and ledge. To the far left, one building transitions into a muted grey-blue brick, adding a slight color variation to the otherwise warm-toned architectural row. The overcast afternoon sky is evenly illuminating the scene.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/116/127/222/651/866/710/original/671d478f7d3384ed.jpeg)

💬 The proposed ban of TP-Link routers due to security concerns related to China is ridiculous. The company is based in Irvine, California. If the worry is about parts sourced from China used in the devices then we need to ban *all* routers, and a multitude of other electronics. The result of such a ban will be a market flooded with routers that are far less secure out of the box. Gun, meet foot.

When I took the train downtown yesterday to walk through Times Square the usual 7-10 minute ride required waiting 50 minutes before an announced train actually arrived. Then it went out of service one stop later. Said screw it and just walked the rest of the way down 8th Avenue.

Rows of parked cars line both sides of the road, each completely buried under thick, rounded mounds of pristine white snow, with only small portions of dark tires or windows peeking through. In the center of the street, two dark slushy tire tracks cut through the white ground, leading the eye toward a bright, hazy vanishing point in the distance. The architecture consists of classic multi-story brick apartment buildings, their fire escapes and windowsills heavily outlined in white, while a vertical red "PARK" sign on the left provides a lone pop of color against the cool blue and gray tones of the scene. Heavy snowflakes are blowing through the scene. A dense canopy of tall, arching deciduous trees creates a natural cathedral ceiling over the roadway. Every delicate, skeletal branch is meticulously coated in a thick layer of heavy, wet snow, forming an intricate white web against the overcast sky. Leading the viewer to the end of the street where visibility is greatly reduced. The atmosphere is quiet and still, with the soft, diffused light of a winter afternoon casting a tranquil mood over the urban landscape.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/116/127/762/323/111/438/original/b7f522c9604a3181.jpeg)

![A color, wide-angle photograph in landscape orientation that captures a serene, snow-blanketed landscape in Central Park during a heavy winter storm. The scene is dominated by a thick layer of pristine white snow covering the ground and clinging heavily to the intricate, leafless branches of a dense grove of trees. The sky is a flat, overcast gray, with visible snowflakes falling throughout the frame, greatly reducing visibility in the distance. In the foreground, an expansive, undisturbed field of snow leads the eye toward a cluster of large, dark-trunked trees that create a high canopy over the park’s rolling hills. Throughout the middle ground, several small figures of people are scattered, enjoying the winter weather. To the left, a few individuals are walking through the deep drifts, while others stand still, taking photos of the picturesque scenery. Towards the center, children and adults are seen sledding down a gentle white slope. On the right side of the image, a small group is actively building a snowman, while nearby, others are in the middle of a snowball fight. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet, wintry playfulness, framed by the stark contrast of the dark wood against the brilliant white snow.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/116/127/870/914/721/273/original/a69184281206f8e6.jpeg)

It has become abundantly clear that the excessive costliness of the places they choose is part of the appeal. I find this to be untoward, and overlooking the fact that the best meals I’ve had in NYC are also some of the cheapest. It’s sort of a beautiful aspect to such an expensive city.
