💬 My bank sends out an email blast with tips on keeping my account secure. Same bank has no support for passkeys, one time use codes via 2FA app, or physical security key. Email and SMS verification codes are the least secure, and yet I’ve never had a bank that used anything else.

💬 I gotta say, pretending you're a neutral party, while also pulling out a decade old list of grievances about just one of the people involved, is pretty classic for internet beef

but it's real amateur hour to make all those insinuations of bad faith yourself, the trick is to lead the reader to those conclusions, and let the people quote tweeting you take on the fight

deeply disingenious, deeply unserious

💬 This is noted "progressive" organizer, activist and PAC leader, not to mention briefly a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, David Hogg, saying that a cabal of international Jewish financiers are successfully influencing our politics, and noted far-right white supremacist Nick Fuentes agreeing with him.

And yes, it really is him and if you want to verify it yourself I'll leave a link to the exchange in a reply to this post.

Friends, please live your lives in such a way that Nick Fuentes does not take time out of his day to come agree with you about the malign influence of the Jews and their money on your country's politics. And if you have been using rhetoric like Hogg's, please let this FINALLY serve as a wake-up call about what you've been saying and who you've been sounding like.

💬 Had numerous people ask me why I published the essay about Ruby/Rails being deserving of non-DHH leadership, but didn’t also sign the below linked open letter. The answer is simply due to it being an internal policy violation with my employer. I had to thread a fine needle with the content of my writing. I understand it is confusing, but the distinction lies in the concept of endorsement/collective action versus the personal commentary I am free to post on my website. 👨🏻‍💻

Numerous Canada Geese are scattered across the water's surface, mostly in the lower right half of the image, floating and swimming. The water shows a thick, mossy algae layer, and the reflections of the sky and trees are muted by its color. The background features a dense line of lush, dark green trees and foliage running horizontally across the frame. The terrain slopes up behind the water to a small, rocky embankment interspersed with trees. On the far right, a small, lighter-colored building is visible on a distant hill above the tree line. The sky above is a mix of bright blue in the upper right, with sweeping, elongated streaks of white cirrus and darker cumulus clouds filling most of the upper frame.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/292/992/642/422/721/original/ef7fc9412950ac46.jpeg)

💬 Whoah. TIL that yt-dlp (the command line video download tool) includes a crude JS "interpreter" (~1k lines of Python).

[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/14404#issuecomment-3330980464](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/14404#issuecomment-3330980464)

via [@cfallin](https://mastodon.world/@cfallin)

![Why can't yt-dlp's native JavaScript interpreter be improved to handle the new YouTube player JS?
Currently, yt-dlp relies on a complicated set of regex patterns to identify the necessary functions in the YouTube player JS, and relies on even more regex to try and interpret that JavaScript code natively within Python.

This code was already hugely costly to maintain. Any time YouTube changed something about their player JS, it would cause multiple maintainers to drop everything and spend all of their free time for the next 2-3 days trying to fix things.

With the latest changes, the necessary functions are spread out all over the player and are much more difficult to identify. Continuing to use the regex-based approach would be far too brittle and far too costly (i.e. maintainers would be spending all of their free time for the next 2-3 weeks after a breakage trying to fix things).

So the regex-based approach has been abandoned in favor of an AST-based approach (https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs), which should allow us to respond much more quickly to changes in the player JS, even as its obfuscation increases.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/291/987/639/198/030/original/b4b06b5415240b6c.png)

I have said this before, and I'll repeat this: forums were a mistake.

💬 I do 1:1s a bit weird apparently. I usually have to warn the people reporting to me about it.

Basically, it's their time to talk about whatever they want. I encourage them to come with an agenda and specific things to talk about.

Usually the first few times they'll start talking about their tasks, and I stop them to say, "I'm happy to hear about these, if it's what you want to talk about. So is it what you want to talk about?"

It takes a few of these for them to realize that I'm serious.

💬 ByteDance trades on the private market at a valuation of ~$300 billion, which is 2x revenues. To put that in perspective, OpenAI is trading at 30x revenues, and it only continues to climb. About 20% of TikTok’s revenue is U.S. based. So if you dilute as part of a sale it should be priced at $60 billion. Instead, it’s being valued the same as Snapchat at $14 billion as a carve up gift to republican donors.

💬 I am interested in learning more about [#passkeys](https://mastodon.social/tags/passkeys) (aka [#passwordless](https://mastodon.social/tags/passwordless)). I've read a few older articles about how, due to the requirement of never allowing a "decrypted" key, passkeys are not portable across "providers".

So if you want to move from an iPhone to Android and you have passkeys associated with your keyring there's no way to move those passkeys to your new phone, you'd be regenerating them all for every service. Is this still the case in 2025, or has progress been made on this front?

💬 👨‍💻 Ah, yet another tedious deep dive into the thrilling world of [#diff](https://mastodon.social/tags/diff) algorithms—because reading [#code](https://mastodon.social/tags/code) diffs in [#Go](https://mastodon.social/tags/Go) is the new Friday night party 🥳. If you ever wondered about the [#existential](https://mastodon.social/tags/existential) [#crisis](https://mastodon.social/tags/crisis) of [#text](https://mastodon.social/tags/text) [#comparison](https://mastodon.social/tags/comparison), here's your chance to drown in mind-numbing verbosity while contemplating arbitrary slices. 🥱🔍

💬 Tedre & Sutinen's "Three traditions of computing: what educators should know" ([https://doi.org/10.1080/08993400802332332](https://doi.org/10.1080/08993400802332332)) had a profound impact on how I think about programming. They distinguish the mathematical, engineering, and scientific perspectives, and describe the aims, methods, and products of each. 1/2

💬 A few years ago, I wrote about one they left out: the humanist tradition (see [https://third-bit.com/2022/12/29/the-fourth-tradition/](https://third-bit.com/2022/12/29/the-fourth-tradition/)). I'm now wondering how much of the shouting about AI comes down to people talking past each other because they are rooted in different perspectives without realizing it. 2/2

💬 🌗 Go 程式語言的差異演算法：詳解與實作
➤ 從現有函式庫的挑戰到自建 Go 差異演算法庫
✤ [https://flo.znkr.io/diff/](https://flo.znkr.io/diff/)
作者 Florian Zenker 分享了他對現有差異（diff）函式庫的不滿，進而開發了一個新的 Go 語言函式庫。文章深入探討了差異演算法的挑戰，包括複雜性、效能與可讀性。作者分析了 Myers 演算法的時空複雜度，並介紹了 Patience Diff 等近似演算法。文中亦強調了不同最小差異在人類可讀性上的差異，並預告了未來將探討 Histogram Diff。
+ 這篇文章對於理解差異演算法的底層原理非常有幫助，特別是關於複雜性和可讀性的討論。
+ 期待作者能分享更多關於 Histogram Diff 的實作細節，這部分聽起來很有潛力！

💬 I wrote up my review of Karen Hao's recent book, Empire of AI, which is all about OpenAI, Sam Altman, and LLMs more generally.

Very well written and researched. Quite scary conclusions. She makes a convincing case that modern AI companies are closer to European countries in their attempts at empire-building and colonizing vast swaths of the public.
