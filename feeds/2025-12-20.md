💬 ual v0.7.5 released

ual is a systems language for orchestration and embedded computation. It now comes in three forms: two compilers (Go and Rust backends) and an interpreter. All three share the same semantics and produce identical results. This release adds a production-ready Rust backend and a threaded-code compiler for the interpreter.

[https://github.com/ha1tch/ual](https://github.com/ha1tch/ual)

What's new

Rust backend with full feature parity — 92/92 examples produce identical output across Go, Rust, and interpreter. Rust binaries are 4× smaller (343K vs 1.3M stripped).

Threaded-code compiler for iual delivers 5–12× speedup on numeric workloads. The interpreter now beats Python by 4–13× while remaining a single-file tool for development.

Automatic target selection: if you have Go, it uses Go. If you only have Rust, it uses Rust. Write once, compile anywhere.

What makes ual different

Coordination is the primary problem; computation happens in designated islands. Data lives in typed stacks accessed through perspectives (LIFO, FIFO, Indexed, Hash). Time is explicit. Errors must be acknowledged.

Binaries available for:
Linux (amd64, arm64, arm, 386), macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon), Windows (64-bit, 32-bit), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD

Release:

💬 i started trying to write a small site in Django recently and I think I'm really enjoying it? I've failed to learn Rails a few times but my Django site is set up so that there's a `models.py` with all my models, `views.py` with all my views and it feels easier for me to find things than it was with Rails

💬 Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan - 41st Street at Eighth Avenue

🌃🚕🌧️

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color photograph in square aspect ratio. A close-up shot that focuses on the rear roofline of a vibrant yellow taxi, covered in thousands of tiny, glistening raindrops. The yellow surface is textured with beads of water that catch the overhead lights, while a black trim piece below it creates a sharp contrast, also saturated with fine mist. To the left, the edge of the taxi roof sign is visible, partially obscured by the angle. The perspective is low and tight, emphasizing the physical texture of the wet car surface against the dark, moody atmosphere of the transit hub. In the blurred background, the street becomes a tunnel beneath the Port Authority terminal. A series of glowing circular lights line the ceiling and recede into the distance. The wet pavement reflects the red and white glow of brake lights and headlights from a line of idling cars. A white SUV and a dark van are visible in soft focus.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/749/713/934/415/245/original/7a71fb1e649d24fc.jpeg)

💬 Revisited the Cookiecutter modernization effort that 
[@danielfeldroy](https://fosstodon.org/@danielfeldroy) 
 and I had started this summer. Yeah! We still want to do it!

First comes getting it into good shape. Baby steps, we just dropped Python 3.9 since it reached EOL at the end of October

Then comes the fun. I'm overflowing with ideas for creative new features after the break. You have no idea what a treat you're in for if you're a Cookiecutter user. 

Also coming is a solid path for sustainability so I don't burn out again

💬 I've come across a problem with the way [#Django](https://mastodon.dazed-gerbil.com/tags/Django) handles authentication which is ... categorically not a problem, unless your brain works in zigzag patterns rather than straight lines.

Django has an is_active boolean in their User model. It's used to identify whether or not a users account is active or not. Obviously. The issue for me is that using the built-in authentication views appears to treat a non-existent and a not active account the same: authenticate() returns None.

💬 If you’ve ever wondered how Christmas affects electricity demand, here’s the data for 2012–2024. Demand starts falling a week before Christmas, and only returns to normal levels a week into the new year, with the three bank holidays having particularly low demand. Christmas Day is the unique day each year without an evening peak in demand as few people cook an evening meal. As ever, you can see the live data at [https://grid.iamkate.com](https://grid.iamkate.com).

![A graph of electricity demand for the three-week period centred around Christmas and New Year’s Day. Demand drops from 37GW on 18th December to 30GW on Christmas Day and Boxing Day, recovers slightly, dips to 31GW on New Year’s Day, and recovers to 37GW by 7th January.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/752/889/467/906/554/original/281debbfd502e148.png)

💬 Chelsea, Manhattan - Eighth Avenue

🏧☕️🎨

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color photograph in portrait orientation captures a decommissioned silver ATM housed within a narrow, dark alcove along Eighth Avenue in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattam on a partly cloudy afternoon. The machine and its surrounding walls are almost entirely covered in a dense layer of street art, including colorful vinyl stickers, hand-drawn art, and scrawled graffiti tags in white, black, and blue ink. A prominent "SUPER" sticker is centered above the keypad area, while a "JESUS SAVES" tag is visible near the bottom. The ATM itself is weathered, with its screen obscured by stickers and its card slot and cash dispenser are empty and hollow, giving the machine a skeletal appearance. The interior walls of the booth are black, serving as a dark canvas for numerous white paint-pen signatures and overlapping stickers. To the bottom, left, and right a blue-patterned frame borders the booth, and a half-full Starbucks iced coffee cup with a brown sleeve sits on the ledge in front of the machine. At the very bottom edge of the frame, a red and white sticker reads "NYS MUSIC." The lighting is somewhat dim, warm, and moody.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/752/908/449/254/183/original/1f7b682997feda41.jpeg)

💬 ual v0.7.5 released

ual is a systems language for orchestration and embedded computation. It now comes in three forms: two compilers (Go and Rust backends) and an interpreter. All three share the same semantics and produce identical results. This release adds a production-ready Rust backend and a threaded-code compiler for the interpreter.

[https://github.com/ha1tch/ual](https://github.com/ha1tch/ual)

What's new

Rust backend with full feature parity — 92/92 examples produce identical output across Go, Rust, and interpreter. Rust binaries are 4× smaller (343K vs 1.3M stripped).

Threaded-code compiler for iual delivers 5–12× speedup on numeric workloads. The interpreter now beats Python by 4–13× while remaining a single-file tool for development.

Automatic target selection: if you have Go, it uses Go. If you only have Rust, it uses Rust. Write once, compile anywhere.

What makes ual different

Coordination is the primary problem; computation happens in designated islands. Data lives in typed stacks accessed through perspectives (LIFO, FIFO, Indexed, Hash). Time is explicit. Errors must be acknowledged.

Binaries available for:
Linux (amd64, arm64, arm, 386), macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon), Windows (64-bit, 32-bit), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD

Release:

💬 [@xgranade](https://wandering.shop/@xgranade) [@glyph](https://mastodon.social/@glyph) I gave a talk a couple months back where I updated "A Modest Proposal" to illustrate the rather alarming state we're in re: AI Industry.

This was within a conference where several talks, including a keynote, were focused on how to implement LLM tools into your workflows.

The response I received was surprising to me. It was overwhelmingly positive from the attendees, a standing ovation if I remember correctly (maybe a couple hundred in the room).   

It feels like, inherently, many developers have some pent up/repressed feelings toward the situation we're in ... but also, maybe they feel resistance is futile... I really can't say. I observe a lot of cognitive dissonance. 

I really do think that in the end, it'd be great if, regardless of where we stand on the "usefulness" debate, we could at least agree on the need for accountability and consequences. (i.e. as Cassandra noted elsewhere, having any sort of useful regulation that's enforceable and pro-worker)
