💬 hmop

Experimenting with a CPU gauge displayed on the Terminal's window title. I should make it configurable, or maybe not? It represents an average of the load of all cores.

If you use the macOS Terminal.app and you'd like to use the CPU gauge it's convenient to disable all the other things that macOS displays by default on the window and tab titles. I don't think I can do that programatically, it will probably just flicker with updates.

💬 Tribeca - Church Street at Reade Street 🖤🤍

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#BlackAndWhite](https://typo.social/tags/BlackAndWhite)

![A black and white street photograph capturing a large plume of steam rising vertically and billowing outwards. The steam dominates the center and upper portion of the frame, creating a soft, ethereal texture against the dark, gritty background. The origin of the steam is low in the frame, a utility vent, and is partially obscured by the framing of the image. The background consists of dark, silhouetted building facades and silver construction scaffolding. Several street signs are visible on the right, including a sign reading "Church St" and a sign below it with a white arrow indicating "ONE WAY." A partial, lighter-colored sign is partially visible with obscured writing through the steam on the left. The scene is high contrast, and the overall mood is dramatic and characteristic of an urban environment, emphasizing texture and the stark contrast between light and shadow.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/420/809/480/206/814/original/f1584c66b7a6c57f.jpeg)

💬 Prompt -> Result [https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html](https://tools.simonwillison.net/terminal-to-html)

![Build a new tool called terminal-to-html which lets the user copy RTF directly from their terminal and paste it into a paste area, it then produces the HTML version of that in a textarea with a copy button, below is a button that says "Save this to a Gist", and below that is a full preview. It will be very similar to the existing rtf-to-html.html tool but it doesn't show the raw RTF and it has that Save this to a Gist button

    That button should do the same trick that openai-audio-output.html does, with the same use of localStorage and the same flow to get users signed in with a token if they are not already

    So click the button, it asks the user to sign in if necessary, then it saves that HTML to a Gist in a file called index.html, gets back the Gist ID and shows the user the URL https://gistpreview.github.io/?6d778a8f9c4c2c005a189ff308c3bc47 - but with their gist ID in it

    They can see the URL, they can click it (do not use target="_blank") and there is also a "Copy URL" button to copy it to their clipboard

    Make the UI mobile friendly but also have it be courier green-text-on-black themed to reflect what it does

    If the user pastes and the pasted data is available as HTML but not as RTF skip the RTF step and process the HTML directly

    If the user pastes and it's only available as plain text then generate HTML that is just an open <pre> tag and their text and a closing </pre> tag](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/421/638/081/854/912/original/6dc20e9fef56fd67.png)

💬 The worldwide AWS-caused outage of 2025 Oct 19-20 appears to have had as its root cause a "latent race condition" in DynamoDB's DNS management subsystem!

Concurrency is hard, kids! Especially at extreme scale.

(ps. I chose Golang as my default proglang in part because of its great design choices related to concurrency and threads. And because of its suitability for network servers wanting super high avail and throughput.)

![A color photograph in portrait orientation of the street scene along Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan on a cloud morning. In the foreground, a low brick building stands out with a classic water tower perched on its roof, flanked by taller, modern glass and steel skyscrapers that dominate the background. The immediate street level features a raised, well-kept flower bed filled with yellow, orange, and red chrysanthemums, providing a burst of color against the dark tones of the surrounding scene and a brown UPS delivery truck waiting in traffic. The overall composition emphasizes the contrast between old and new architecture, with the central brick structure showing signs of aging, including boarded-up windows on both its beige and darker brick sections. The tall buildings behind it include one dark and geometric on the left, and a cylindrical, modern skyscraper on the right. A traffic light and street signs are visible on the right, with a red ‘Don’t walk’ hand signaling pedestrian traffic. Beyond the traffic sign there are cars parked along a side street. There are no people, and no movement in the scene.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/424/173/014/137/486/original/8b148b74cd5485de.jpeg)

💬 🚀 Wow, [#Go](https://mastodon.social/tags/Go) can now access files 25 times faster with MMAP! But let's not get too excited—it's like putting a turbo on a tricycle. 🐢 Meanwhile, [#Varnish](https://mastodon.social/tags/Varnish) is still doing its best to sound like a fancy condiment. 🥒

💬 🌗 記憶體對映(mmap)如何為 Go 程式帶來 25 倍更快的檔案存取速度
➤ 解密 Go 語言中利用記憶體對映實現極致檔案存取速度的奧祕
✤ [https://info.varnish-software.com/blog/how-memory-maps-mmap-deliver-25x-faster-file-access-in-go](https://info.varnish-software.com/blog/how-memory-maps-mmap-deliver-25x-faster-file-access-in-go)
本文探討了在 Go 語言中利用記憶體對映（mmap）技術，能大幅提升檔案存取效能，相較於傳統的 ReaderAt 讀取方式，可帶來高達 25 倍的讀取速度提升。作者透過實際 Go 程式庫的效能測試，展示了 mmap 在隨機查找和迭代讀取上的顯著優勢。儘管 mmap 在寫入操作上因頁面錯誤處理機制顯得低效，但在讀取密集型應用場景下，它能有效減少系統呼叫的開銷，並降低記憶體壓力，為需要處理大量 I/O 的應用程式提供了一種強大的效能優化方案。
+ 這篇文章解釋了 mmap 的原理和優點，特別是在 Go 語言中的應用，非常實用！數字化的對比也讓效能提升的幅度一目瞭然。
+ 對於需要處理大量檔案 I/O 的專案來說，

💬 [@andrew](https://fedi.aeracode.org/@andrew) I think we just found ours a few hours ago, but I didn't think about our GoPro using one.

💬 📱 My favorite iPhone 17 Pro Max / iOS bug is that my volume buttons do not work. 

📴 I have found the setting that should enable it, but nope. Luckily, I can use the volume slider in the UI, but what a dumb bug.
