💬 You've got to respect Apple's decision to not implement any loader/spinner/activity indicator when performing operations on iCloud files—probably assuming they’ll be fast enough. That's the kind of decision you can only make when you have tight vertical integration.

💬 The "Vibe Coding Keyboard" How I Made My Walk-and-Talk Setup Even More Awesome: [https://micro.webology.dev/2025/11/19/the-vibe-coding-keyboard-how/](https://micro.webology.dev/2025/11/19/the-vibe-coding-keyboard-how/)

Ever tried typing while walking on a treadmill desk? It's awkward.

So I built myself a "Vibe Coding Keyboard" - a tiny 4-key mechanical keyboard dedicated to voice control. The vibe key even cycles through rainbow colors because why not?

If you're into voice coding or just want a fun side project, check out how I set it up 👇

On top of the modifications in the original post, there is an angry bird (Red) flying towards the tower. It takes the place of the Microsoft blob (but is still labelled "Whatever Microsoft is doing)

The remaining modifications from the original post are: 

AWS and Cloudflare hold up the left side of the stack with a medium sized platform.
Unpaid Open Source Developers hold up the right side of the stack on a tiny pillar. DNS forms two tiny pillars on either side of the stack holding up the majority.
Below them the Linux Foundation forms an entire platform holding up the entire stack.

At a minimum, I should make it a blog post on djangoproject.com so it appears in the search though.

💬 Django used to be known as “the meat grinder” because it would take volunteer contributors and chew them up. The Django Fellowship Program was created to ensure the core work on the framework was paid. It’s the reason Django has been able to continue so successfully all these years.

💬 A worrying number of influential people seem to have forgotten how bubbles work. When the bubble starts to burst it won’t first manifest in Nvidia’s results, but in smaller loss-making AI start-ups struggling to secure the investor funding they need to keep operating. This will slowly propagate to larger loss-making AI companies, and the collapse will be well underway by the time it shows up in Nvidia’s results.

Their share price, which had risen from $7 to $333 in just a year, collapsed to $120 in a single day, in an event that is regarded as the start of the dotcom bubble bursting.

Open source gives a lot but demands much in return. This is a healthy cycle of things as Carlton is doing it.

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color photograph of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree setup this year, prior to being lit on December 3rd. It is nighttime. The focal point of the image is a massive vertical dark blue banner hanging centrally over a complex metal scaffolding structure that has been built around the tree, and obscuring the usual view of the Rockefeller Center plaza backdrop. The banner features a large, stylized white line drawing of a Christmas tree formed by a continuous, tapering spiral, topped with a gold starburst design. At the bottom of the banner, the Art Deco "Rockefeller Center" logo is printed in white. The scaffolding extends high into the air, flanked by the illuminated cool-blue and yellow windows of towering city skyscrapers at night. Below the main blue banner and a green construction ledge, a lower barrier displays a graphic of the famous gold Prometheus statue with text reading "Restoring a Masterpiece" and "The Rink." The plaza level is lined with flags on poles, and small tent-like structures with peaked roofs and warm string lights frame the bottom corners of the scene.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/582/153/810/579/494/original/19e7c00e5c42547f.jpeg)

Totally missed Go's 16 years old anniversary.

I actually wanted to dig into `go fix` which I think is an amazing tool, especially when you create a library that moves too much before stabilization. (which is the case for my [https://rip.rest](https://rip.rest) lib).
I was afraid that `go fix` disappears as Go has become very stable.

But it's quite the opposite and they reinvest in it. GREAT NEWS!

Ever tried typing while walking on a treadmill desk? It's awkward.

 So I built myself a "Vibe Coding Keyboard" - a tiny 4-key mechanical keyboard dedicated to voice control. One key toggles MacWhisper dictation. The vibe key even cycles through rainbow colors because why not?

If you're into voice coding or just want a fun side project, check out how I set it up 👇

The path is lined with trees displaying vibrant, bright yellow fall foliage. The path recedes into the distance where it meets a city street. The area is framed by the yellow canopy overhead, with a scattering of fallen yellow leaves on the ground. A tall, black wrought-iron fence runs along the left side of the path, separating it from a slightly raised area featuring some shrubs and the backs of brick buildings with reddish tones. A few trees on the far right show darker, brownish-red leaves, contrasting with the dominant yellow.
In the middle distance, the path opens up to a view of a small white delivery van parked across the street at the end of the walkway, partially obscured by the trees and a lamp post.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/582/579/832/685/195/original/3ae33aebc8f824b9.jpeg)

💬 Worth noting with Mastodon - one of the reasons for no cookie consent popup is.. there are no tracking cookies.  At all.  

Similar with official mobile apps, there's no privacy agreements etc in the app stores as there's no third party tracking.

Why is this notable?  Try doing the same check on Facebook, X, Instagram, Threads, Bluesky or basically anywhere or anything else online.  It's basically unheard of in 2025, as everybody else is selling you.

💬 🚀 Django LiveView 2.0.0 is now available

I just released a major new version of Django LiveView, the framework that lets you build interactive, real-time web applications using only Python — no JavaScript required.

🎯 What is Django LiveView?

A radically simpler way to build dynamic interfaces with Django. Inspired by Phoenix LiveView and Laravel Livewire, it lets you create SPAs without APIs, without JavaScript frameworks, without splitting your logic between frontend and backend.

HTML over WebSockets — all interactivity works in real-time, logic lives in Python, and you use Django's template system.

🔧 Simplified configuration

pip install django-liveview

## 💪 What can you do with LiveView?

- ✅ Update the DOM in real-time without JavaScript
- ✅ Interactive forms with instant validation
- ✅ Infinite scroll and lazy loading
- ✅ Multi-user live notifications
- ✅ Real-time dashboards
- ✅ Search with instant results
- ✅ Everything with Python decorators and Django templates

📚 More information

If you're a Django developer and want to add real-time features without the complexity of a separate frontend, give LiveView a try.

💬 Got the next part of this working. 
Documents can be made and versioned, they update anywhere you plug them in. 

And you can add an 'element' to a document. You can also add many elements to one document,. 

So if you had something like oh this update is important you add the element, make the connection to the document and it does all the other work anywhere that plugin is located.

This was such a breath of fresh air. Here's the summary of what I answered:

- I wish it was more amenable to scripting tasks
- I want it to be normalized for tasks like writing DAGs, Lambdas, or other simple glue things
- Though not impossible, Data Science is not as intuitive as other languages

the operating systems kinda flirted with it but apps didn't, so i am pretty confident that the thing that finally got everybody up to speed was they had to deal with xml

💬 Speak of putting in effort and understanding another human.

I got a gift today by the event I spoke in. It's a notebook but not just any swag notebook.

It's a notebook where the cover is a photo of my old laptop with all of its stickers. And the backcover is a photo of a laptop bottom with the event logo in it.

They understood deeply what matters to me and what kind of a person (passionate notetaker) I am.

I've gotten quite a few speaker gifts over the years but nothing as personal as this.
