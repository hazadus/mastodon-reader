💬 📱I added my mom to my Apple family plan and gave her my three-year-old iPhone which should be a huge upgrade for her ~seven-year-old iPhone. 

This has my looking at moving both of my kids to their own accounts. This feels like it'd solve a bunch of minor issues we run into, including letting my eight-year-old message us from his own account instead of via mine. 

Not sure how many parents went through this or what the right age was for them?

💬 🎮 This is pretty cool. For being "slow", Python and Django can now run doom at 60 FPS using Django LiveView. 

This feels like a fun benchmark to start comparing various Django libraries with.

💬 Atlantic City, New Jersey - Westminster Avenue 🐙🎨

[#Art](https://typo.social/tags/Art) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color, wide-angle photograph in landscape orientation that captures a massive, vibrant mural painted across a long, two-story industrial building under a pale, overcast winter afternoon sky in Atlantic City. The mural features an enormous octopus with thick, swirling tentacles in shades of coral pink and golden orange, textured with detailed suction cups. The creature is set against a backdrop of stylized ocean waves in various shades of blue and periwinkle, which transition on the right side of the building into a dark indigo night sky dotted with small, yellow stars. Black, ink-like drips trail down from the tentacles and window frames, adding a sense of movement and depth to the artwork. The building itself is white with two rows of large, grid-style industrial windows that are integrated into the art; the upper windows sit within the blue waves, while the lower windows are set against the plain white wall of the first floor. A small white penthouse structure with a black metal ladder and door sits atop the roof on the left side. In the foreground, an empty asphalt parking lot shows yellow painted stall lines stretching toward the base of the building.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/795/133/245/706/929/original/4db5ca89f1ea643c.jpeg)

💬 So without making a conscious choice I've been using and loving some excellent Go-lang software: [#Hugo](https://gts.shom.dev/tags/hugo), [#GoToSocial](https://gts.shom.dev/tags/gotosocial), and [#Readeck](https://gts.shom.dev/tags/readeck). I don't know Go but I've picked up some templating from customizing Hugo, is it time I learned more? [Let's Go](https://shom.dev/posts/20251228_let-s-go/) (blog post)!

Nothing I am going to make with Go can't just as easily be slopped together and probably better, but learning things with your own brain is punk AF!

P.S. If any [#Emacs](https://gts.shom.dev/tags/emacs) folks have a nice configuration for [#Go](https://gts.shom.dev/tags/go) using vertico/consult/corfu and friends, please let me steal liberate your config.

💬 Not everyone needs to be outstanding, famous, or noteworthy.

Admire people who show up, chip in, and do the work.

(Edited for clarity: this emphatically does not apply solely to paid labour. If you think showing up, chipping in, and doing the work is something people can only do for corporations, you're dead wrong.)

A while back you made a point about Python not really still being "small enough to fit in your head" (Or at least I think I remember you saying that.) I was trying to find the origin of the "small enough to fit in your head" idea, but couldn't find a good one. Would you happen to have a pointer? Thanks! Happy New Year! 🥳

💬 [@carlton](https://chaos.social/@carlton) So far as I know, the "it fits your brain" was the slogan attached to the 9th International Python Conference in Long Beach (2001).  It's attributed to Bruce Eckel ([https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4731](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4731)) although the general sentiment behind the idea would have been pervasive in the community already I think.

💬 The massive book at the bottom is Introduction To Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest. I won it when I reached the national final of a programming competition aged 17, but it was so intimidatingly dense with mathematical analysis of algorithm performance that it took me 25 years to get round to reading it.

💬 When I moved to NYC the cost of a single subway/bus ride was $2.25, and it has slowly creeped up since then. On January 4th the price will increase by 10¢ to be an even $3. Yes it increases, but between inflation and a majorly fiscally irresponsible transit authority, a total of +75¢ in 15 years doesn’t seem that outlandish to me. I am still in the camp who believes the price should start higher and scale down in price the more you tap your card to ride. A tourist tax, essentially.

💬 Atlantic City, New Jersey - Steel Pier

☁️🎡🌊

[#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#SilentSunday](https://typo.social/tags/SilentSunday)

![A color, wide-angle photograph that captures the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey, extending into the ocean under a heavy, overcast gray sky. The pier is supported by a long row of dark vertical pilings that disappear into the churning, foamy white surf of the Atlantic Ocean. On the left side of the pier, a massive Ferris wheel dominates the skyline, its circular frame fitted with numerous passenger gondolas and accented by subtle rainbow changing lighting. To the right of the wheel, various amusement park attractions are visible, including several tall, thin vertical drop towers, a blue-railed roller coaster, and small white structures for concession stands. An illuminated silver sign on the far left reads “STEEL PIER.” In the foreground, a wide stretch of light gray sandy beach occupies the lower part of the frame. The shoreline is scattered with small white seagulls near the water's edge. On the far left, a low wooden fence with dark posts and rope is partially buried in the sand, while several weathered wooden beams stick out of the beach at an angle. The water is a dark, murky gray-green, with waves breaking into white foam as they roll toward the shore. The horizon line is flat and distant, meeting the thick layer of clouds that creates a moody scene.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/798/067/339/820/044/original/e3473690eccde506.jpeg)

“Life is a maze. Find your way.”

[#Art](https://typo.social/tags/Art) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#SilentSunday](https://typo.social/tags/SilentSunday)

![A color, medium-angle photograph that captures a vibrant, three-story building in Atlantic City that is completely covered in a mural that depicts a complex, interlocking maze of colorful lines. The mural features thick, intertwined paths in shades of teal, navy blue, and orange set against a white background, with many paths ending in arrowheads pointing in various directions. The architectural elements of the building, including six rectangular windows on the upper floors and several doors at ground level, are integrated into the design. Some windows are clear, while others are boarded up with plywood, and the ground-level doors are painted white with small red and white warning symbols. The mural includes several pieces of text that emphasize its theme. Across the top, the phrase "Life is a maze" is written in red, lowercase letters. Near the bottom, a large red rectangular sign on the left reads "START" in bold white capital letters, while a matching sign on the right reads "FINISH." Between these two signs, the phrase "find your way" is scripted in red lowercase letters across the maze paths. In the bottom left corner, the hashtag #48BLOCKSAC is visible, and on the bottom right, the artist's handle @MAZINGARTSTUDIO is credited. The building is situated on a city street under a cloudy winter morning sky, flanked by a plain beige building on the left and a red brick building with an alleyway and red dumpsters on the right.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/798/105/838/163/715/original/e59c6cb595d51d15.jpeg)

Первая часть цикла «Разбираем net/http на практике»: создаём с нуля сервис DeadDrop — аналог Privnote для безопасной передачи самоуничтожающихся сообщений и файлов. На чистой стандартной библиотеке net/http разбираем основы: • запуск HTTP-сервера • маршрутизация в ServeMux • написание middleware (логирование и recovery от panic) • работа с HTML-шаблонами и layout’ами • подключение статики через http.FileServer и embed.FS В итоге получаем работающий сервер с красивой главной страницей, формой создания «ячейки» и базовой архитектурой проекта — всё без внешних зависимостей. Идеально для начинающих и тех, кто хочет глубоко понять внутренности популярных фреймворков вроде Gin и Echo. Пишем код вместе!

💬 Well, I've made it through Chapter 23 on control flow and have loops working.  Functions await.  I suspect things are going to get bad now.    Maybe a break for lunch first. And maybe a nap.

💬 I understand (yet don't agree) on the social media ban for children some countries have implemented and others are discussing.

However, if we look at the state of some societies right now, I don't think it's just kids who need to stay away from platforms like Facebook, X and TikTok.

Of course, the real problem is not "social media" but rather the companies who run these corporate controlled, rage bait algorithm fueled money makers.

💬 I like having the shape of things memorized. I like being fluent in the codebases I work on. human memorization works via repeated exposure. it's fine to automate certain things (so long as the automation tool is deterministic) but do it with the awareness that you'll lose the opportunity to become good and knowledgable about something through your menial interactions with it

💬 Another one of those comfort-books for me is "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Toshiro Kageyama. 
The title says everything and yet it is so much fun to me to read. He has a very funny and light-hearted approach and writing style. It is always nice to come back to this book and to the fundamentals for that matter ;D

💬 Port Authority Bus Terminal 🚌🌊🎰

Taken at 6am on Christmas morning. 🦉🎄

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#SilentSunday](https://typo.social/tags/SilentSunday)

![A color, wide-angle photograph that captures a wide, desolate interior view of the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City, very early on Christmas Day morning, characterized by its distinctive mid-century modern aesthetic. The room is dominated by high-gloss, cream-colored floors that reflect the overhead lighting and a digital kiosk in the center. Large rectangular structural pillars are spaced throughout the hall, some featuring a repeating pattern of light-gray bus icons and others showcasing a large, minimalist red outline of a bus. The walls in the background are finished in a deep red glazed brick, contrasting with the neutral tones of the floor and the linear, slatted metal ceiling.
In the mid-ground, numbered gates such as "310" and "311" are visible above recessed doorways, appearing dark and inactive. To the right, a stack of green plastic transport bins sits on a metal cart, while a hand sanitizer station stands solitary nearby. Black doors to bathrooms flank either side of the space. A digital advertisement kiosk stands prominently in the center of the hall, displaying a vibrant blue and yellow graphic for free Wi-Fi, providing the only bright source of color in the otherwise muted space. The complete absence of people and the sterile, brightly lit environment emphasize the quiet stillness of the terminal during the early morning hours.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/798/861/601/938/376/original/5a23a3b8a76c1273.jpeg)

💬 Central Park 🪾❄️

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#SilentSunday](https://typo.social/tags/SilentSunday)

![A color, wide-angle, landscape photograph captures a serene, snow-covered scene of The Pond at Central Park under a heavy, overcast grey sky. The water in the foreground is still and dark, partially covered by a thin, smooth layer of ice that reflects the muted light. To the left, dense thickets of bare trees and shrubs are heavily blanketed in fresh white snow, their branches bowing slightly toward the water's edge. In the distance, the iconic stone silhouette of Gapstow Bridge arches gracefully over the water, its dark masonry contrasting against the white landscape and the skeletal, snow-dusted trees surrounding it. The middle ground is filled with a soft thicket of deciduous trees, all uniformly coated in white, creating a monochromatic and wintry atmosphere. Just behind the treeline, the faint, hazy twin spires of the San Remo apartment building are visible against the pale sky, providing a subtle hint of the Manhattan skyline. Small, dark figures of people can be seen scattered along the pathways near the bridge, appearing as tiny specks against the expansive white scenery. The overall mood is quiet and cold, capturing the hushed stillness of the park immediately following a winter storm.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/798/918/048/291/962/original/04865afa0c39a624.jpeg)

💬 Harlem, Manhattan 🪾❄️

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Winter](https://typo.social/tags/Winter) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color, medium-angle photograph in square aspect ratio that captures a cluster of snow-covered, dark-barked trees on a snowy hillside in Harlem. The trees, with their intricate network of bare branches, dominate the foreground and midground, their surfaces dusted with a thick layer of fresh, white snow. The snow also blankets the sloping ground, revealing small  patches of grass poking through. In the lower-left corner, a discarded, empty plastic water bottle lies partially submerged in the snow. Behind the trees, a black wrought-iron fence runs along the perimeter of a brick building. A set of stone stairs leads up to a landing, their surfaces also covered in snow. The building's brickwork, in shades of brown and tan, provides a textured backdrop to the scene. A red sign with white lettering is partially visible on the left side of the image. The overall atmosphere is one of quiet stillness.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/799/564/815/148/033/original/109d3cc998488d38.jpeg)
