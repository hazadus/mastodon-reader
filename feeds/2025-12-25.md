💬 Midtown Manhattan - 57th Street at Park Avenue

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#Architecture](https://typo.social/tags/Architecture)

![A color photograph in landscape orientation that captures an architectural close-up of a vertical slice of Manhattan’s skyline against a medium blue sky filled with scattered white clouds. In the foreground on the left, an older masonry building features a stepped, wedding-cake style facade with light-colored brick and a series of dark-framed windows, some of which are illuminated from within by a warm golden glow. This traditional structure contrasts sharply with the massive glass skyscraper behind it, which dominates the center and right of the frame. The modern tower’s reflective surface is divided into a grid of windows that catch the intense light of the golden hour, creating a rhythmic pattern of amber, turquoise, and deep shadow. The composition emphasizes the density and verticality of the city through a tight crop that eliminates the street level, focusing instead on the intersection of different architectural eras. The golden hour light casts a brilliant sheen on the glass panels, mirroring the sky and nearby buildings in distorted, shimmering patches of color. Towards the far right, the northern edge of the building is visible, its surface reflecting the cool tones of the sky.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/777/377/835/343/909/original/d3a960de98213a2b.jpeg)

💬 Today while washing my hands I managed to hold one hand under the soap dispenser in a way that caused the soap to splash at just the right angle for some of it to go into my eye.

💬 Thackeray said it well:

My song, save this, is little worth;
I lay the weary pen aside,
And wish you health, and love, and mirth,
As fits the solemn Christmas-tide.
As fits the holy Christmas birth,
Be this, good friends, our carol still—
Be peace on earth, be peace on earth,
To men of gentle will.

💬 Performance is design, and every millisecond counts.

Every update in 2025 trimmed Obsidian's load speed. This is quite complex given the number of different configurations and operating systems Obsidian supports.

We employed many different solutions to speed up Obsidian across various syncing methods, operating systems, plugins, vault sizes, etc. 
Getting into Obsidian should be instantaneous regardless of vault size. It's absolutely necessary so that ideas can flow without friction.

💬 Новогодний подарок: Как я прикрутил LLM к scratch и порадовал ребёнка

Как известно, под новый год случаются чудеса, и этот год не стал исключением. Мне удалось прикрутить LLM в визуальный язык программирования Scratch, чем и обрадовал ребенка. А началось всё в один прекрасный день, когда мой сын - школьник осваивал n8n и ваял телеграм бота. Разговорившись, мы вспомнили, что его увлечение программированием началось со Scratch. И его фраза, что было бы здорово, если бы в scratch была бы встроена иишечка, можно столько прикольных игр сделать, стала отправной точкой для данного проекта. Рассказываю и показываю, как мы реализовали эту безумную идею.

💬 GPLv2 affirmation…

I don’t generally post here as people have probably noticed, but here’s a pdf of a recent court ruling, and this turns out to be the easiest way for me to link to a copy of it, since I don’t really maintain any web presence normally and I don’t want to post pdf’s to the kernel mailing lists or anything like that.

And the reason I want to post about it, is that it basically validates my long-held views that the GPLv2 is about making source code available, not controlling the access to the hardware that it runs on.

The court case itself is a mess of two bad parties: Vizio and the SFC. Both of them look horribly bad in court - for different reasons.

Vizio used Linux in their TVs without originally making the source code available, and that was obviously not ok.

And the Software Freedom Conservancy then tries to make the argument that the license forces you to make your installation keys etc available, even though that is not the case, and the reason why the kernel is very much GPLv2 only. The people involved know that very well, but have argued otherwise in court.

End result: both parties have acted badly. But at least Vizio did fix their behavior, even if it apparently took this lawsuit to do so. I can’t say the same about the SFC. 

Please, SFC - stop using the kernel for your bogus legal arguments where you try to expand the GPLv2 to be something it isn’t. You just look like a bunch of incompetent a**holes.

The only party that looks competent here is the judge, which in this ruling says

Plaintiff contends the phrases, “machine-readable” and “scripts used to control compilation and installation” support their assertion in response to special interrogatory no. 4 that Defendant should “deliver files such that a person of ordinary skill can compile the source code into a functional executable and install it onto the same device, such that all features of the original program are retained, without undue difficulty.”

The language of the Agreements is unambiguous. It does not impose the duty which is the subject of this motion.

Read as a whole, the Agreements require Vizio to make the source code available in such a manner that the source code can be readily obtained and modified by Plaintiff or other third parties. While source code is defined to include “the scripts used to control compilation and installation,” this does not mean that Vizio must allow users to reinstall the software, modified or otherwise, back   onto its smart TVs in a manner that preserves all features of the    original program and/or ensures the smart TVs continue to function properly. Rather, in the context of the Agreements, the disputed language means that Vizio must provide the source code in a manner that allows the source code to be obtained and revised by Plaintiff or others for use in other applications.

In other words, Vizio must ensure the ability of users to copy, change/modify, and distribute the source code, including using the code in other free programs consistent with the Preamble and Terms and Conditions of the Agreements. However, nothing in the language of the Agreements requires Vizio to allow modified source code to be reinstalled on its devices while ensuring the devices remain operable after the source code is modified. If this was the intent of the Agreements, the Agreements could have been readily modified to state that users must be permitted to modify and reinstall modified software on products which use the program while ensuring the products continue to function. The absence of such language is dispositive and there is no basis to find that such a term was implied here. Therefore, the motion is granted.

IOW, this makes it clear that yes, you have to make source code available, but no, the GPLv2 does not in any way force you to then open up your hardware.

My intention - and the GPLv2 - is clear: the kernel copyright licence covers the software, and does not extend to the hardware it runs on. The same way the kernel copyright license does not extend to user space programs that run on it.

💬 The Apple Maps app has a feature when viewing upcoming bus departures to label them ‘crowded’ or ‘not crowded’. What I have come to learn is that this is far from accurate because it depends on the majority of riders to be using an iPhone. It also depends on those iPhone users not disabling location permission for ‘Maps Improvement’ under the system services pane in the Settings app. So when I get on a bus marked ‘not crowded’ and it’s packed with people I know I am surrounded by privacy conscious iOS users, and Android phones. 🗺️📱🚌

[#Art](https://typo.social/tags/Art) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color, wide-angle photograph in landscape orientation that captures a large-scale mural of stylized jellyfish covering the weathered side of a building next to a parking lot. The mural stretches across the wall in a textured blue background that mimics a deep ocean scene. The jellyfish are depicted in shades of golden yellow, fiery orange, and deep navy blue, with long, delicate, wire-like tentacles that trail downward and intertwine toward the bottom of the wall. Subtle patterns of light blue circles and dots are scattered across the background to suggested bubbles. The mural has a slightly distressed appearance, with patches of the underlying masonry showing through, giving the artwork a rustic, urban feel. Integrated into the mural’s composition are two small, rectangular windows located in the upper right part of the frame. The window on the left is open with white-painted frames, while the window further to the right is completely boarded up with dark wood. At the very bottom of the image, a chain-link fence runs along the base of the building, partially obscuring the lower trailing edges of the jellyfish tentacles.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/781/557/007/449/302/original/0b1cbebfe3b76c11.jpeg)

[#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color photograph in 5:4 aspect ratio captures the intense glow of a campfire at night. Vivid orange and golden yellow flames rise upward in wispy, translucent waves around several thick, charred logs. The wood is in various stages of combustion, with some pieces appearing as blackened charcoal with deep fissures, while others show a warm, orange-red glow from the internal heat. Light gray smoke mingles with the flames, creating a sense of movement and warmth against the dark, shadowy background. The base of the fire consists of a bed of ashen embers and smaller bits of glowing wood scattered across a rough, earthy ground. The lighting is dramatic, with the fire itself serving as the primary light source, casting a strong, warm amber glow on the surrounding textures of the wood and dirt while leaving the upper corners of the frame in deep shadow. The intricate details of the wood grain and the fluid, almost liquid-like shapes of the rising heat create a scene that is both energetic and cozy.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/782/498/215/614/207/original/68385ff84dd3579b.jpeg)

![A color, medium-angle photograph in square aspect ratio. An eye-level shot captures a desaturated and overcast day at an Atlantic City beach. In the lower right foreground, a rusted, bright yellow metal trash barrel sits partially buried in the sand, with several dark and light-colored articles of clothing draped over its rim. The vast expanse of the beach is composed of pale, grey-toned sand textured with countless footprints and subtle ripples. In the mid-ground, a scattered flock of seagulls rests near the shoreline, while the dark blue ocean waves break into white foam against the coast. Two dark wooden pilings stand vertically in the shallow water, and a low rock jetty extends into the surf on the left. The upper half of the image is dominated by a heavy, moody sky filled with thick layers of horizontal grey clouds. A single seagull is captured in flight in the upper left, its wings spread against the overcast backdrop. The overall color palette is muted and cool, leaning into deep blues and slate greys, which makes the weathered yellow of the trash can stand out as the primary focal point. The horizon line is sharp and flat, separating the turbulent dark water from the expansive, gloomy sky, evoking a sense of quiet isolation on a cold coastal day.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/782/840/621/483/635/original/e0f1945451cc37d0.jpeg)
