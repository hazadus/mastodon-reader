💬 I went to Times Square for the NYE ball drop once, and that was enough for me. If you want even a chance of being able to see the ball from the front / being near the stage then you want to get down there at 12 noon. 

Once it’s over it takes a very long time to get out of the area, then traffic is standstill, the subway stations are a packed full booze filled nightmare, and you are tired from standing in freezing temps for thirteen hours. 

People come from all over the country and world for the experience, but when you live here it’s not an annual tradition by any means if you actually want an enjoyable evening. Watching it on television with a small group of friends is much more my speed. 🎊

💬 TIL I published a new blog post more than once per week (on average) in 2025! 🤯

$ git ls-files app/markdown/* | grep 2025 | wc -l

is returning "56" total blog posts. 2024 had only 34, so I'm definitely getting better at publishing.

There's even more coming in 2026 (I have two blog posts drafted and ready to go...) I have been taking my own advice from my 5-year blog-iversary to heart: create what you want, don't put yourself in a box, and value shipping over tweaking.

💬 I'm mostly doing this for myself, a way to look back and see the year for what it was. Negatives tend to stand out in our memories: pain, anger, a slight we didn't appreciate, a loss we did not anticipate... all this quickly coalesces into a gloom and doom spiral, a "search and you will find" approach to seeing things as dark as possible.

2025 in Code.

The first months were all about learning and using [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). We wrote [Camino Now](https://camino.now/), got out first 20,000 users, and celebrated on the [Camino Francés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Way) in a Hot Tub.

To fully make Camino Now work, I also had to learn more about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to write the backend. That one was a bit of a drag, but worked out, and by May we had a working version that served those 20,000 users with ease. 

Around October, I started using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) more, including [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and was often blown away by how much easier things got, when redid them in Ruby. I still love Python and can't think of any language more suitable for my needs, but rewriting all of Camino Now's backend in Ruby took a week, which was astounding.

The next version of Camino Now will be web based, not bound to an app, and might be written in Ruby and Rails. 

Other Projects

Hule (this website) is written in Python. It features a Microblog-Macroblog backend, federation into the ⁂ Fediverse, [Photo-First approach](https://mikka.is/pics/), Wiki pages, and Fediverse threads being displayed intelligently. Hule works rather well, serves me well, and seems to make me want to write more and more coherently. The Wiki will slowly become a collection of "Days in Medical History" over this year.

Train Track has nothing to do with Trains and will be my personal training tracker for 2025. The goal is to reach a very healthy 75 kilos by the end of this year, run a half marathon, and get fit enough to do even higher ascents and mountains. I'll show you guys what I wrote in a few days.

Conclusion

I got more fluent in Python, learned Dart and Flutter, and rediscovered Ruby for web based projects and quick CLI scripting. All in all, a good year in that regard, and one that sets the foundation for 2026.

💬 I’m starting the year by tackling misinformation. I know some anti-renewables people look at my National Grid: Live site at [https://grid.iamkate.com](https://grid.iamkate.com), as I’ve occasionally had donations thanking me for “exposing the net zero scam” (which just goes to show how preconceptions can affect the interpretation of data). I’ve now updated the price pop-up to mention that the structure of the British electricity market means that electricity prices are set by the price of gas 98% of the time. Maybe it will get through to someone?

![Screenshot of the price pop-up on National Grid: Live. It says:

As a market-traded commodity, electricity doesn’t have just one price: buyers and sellers can enter into contracts hours, days, weeks, or months in advance. This site shows the price on the APX spot market, which reflects the real-time wholesale price of electricity in Great Britain.

During periods of low demand and high renewable power generation, prices can fall below zero due to the Contracts For Difference scheme. However, the structure of the British electricity market means that electricity prices are set by the price of gas 98% of the time. Soaring gas prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have caused household electricity bills to more than double, leading to a cost-of-living crisis.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/819/734/770/781/123/original/f9eb1bb6d6df1654.png)

![A color, wide-angle photograph taken from an elevated perspective looking down the main hall of the Oculus at the World Trade Center in New York City. The architectural space is characterized by a massive, white ribbed ceiling that curves upward to a central skylight, resembling the skeletal structure of a bird’s wings or a whale's ribcage. The symmetry of the white steel beams creates a striking sense of verticality and light. The polished white marble floor below reflects the bright overhead morning lighting, and a very few scattered pedestrians walk across the vast, open expanse. In the mid-ground, rows of white, circular seating pods are arranged for visitors. The transition between the lower retail levels and the soaring ceiling is marked by festive holiday decorations. Thick green evergreen garlands, draped in uniform scallops, are hung along the balconies of the second level, on both the left and right sides of the hall. The garlands are accented with small, silver ornaments and warm lights, providing a sharp organic contrast to the sharp, futuristic lines of the white architecture. In the far distance, a mezzanine level features additional holiday greenery and a small yellow kiosk, while the very back of the hall leads toward the subway entrances and further terminal corridors.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/820/162/063/626/450/original/9b25f3c90665cd46.jpeg)

![A color photograph in portrait orientation that captures a vibrant public art installation located at the South Oculus Plaza in New York City. The sculpture, part of the "Rewind" series by artist WhIsBe, consists of three oversized, stacked alphabet blocks that spell out "NYC" vertically. The top block is red with a blue letter "N," the middle is yellow with a green letter "Y," and the bottom is blue with a pinkish-purple letter "C." Each block features deeply recessed white panels that make the raised, colorful letters pop, mimicking the classic aesthetic of traditional wooden toy blocks but on a massive scale. The sculpture is positioned on a dark, reflective pedestal, which subtly mirrors the bright colors of the blocks in the early morning sunlight. In the background, the soft-focus, white vertical ribs of the Oculus transportation hub rise into the air, providing a clean, modern contrast to the playful, primary colors of the artwork.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/820/308/238/755/189/original/31f1508b165d40cd.jpeg)

Two NYPD officers in dark blue uniforms and high-visibility vests are visible in the distance on the right, managing the setup. To the left and center, the park is filled with rows of honey-locust trees, their trunks and branches wrapped in thousands of glowing warm-white fairy lights. Nestled among the trees is the bottom portion of the "Joie de Vivre" sculpture—a massive, bright red, tripod-like steel structure by artist Mark di Suvero. The ground appears damp, suggesting recent rain or a morning cleaning. The scene is quiet but industrious, capturing the "calm before the storm" as the city prepares for the public block party and swearing-in ceremony at nearby City Hall.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/820/514/442/818/732/original/8d9ea96820889c59.jpeg)

💬 Day 9.  Well, made it to the end of Chapter 29 and the end of the basic Lox project.  Everything seems to be working.    By my clock, I've logged about 54 hours of effort.   ed (the standard editor) has logged a total of 3.25 seconds of CPU time in this endeavor.

The final chapter 30 is on some optimization things.   Rather than focus on that, I've got a number of loose ends and code cleanup things throughout that I can pursue.  So, I'm going to work on that for awhile. 

This has been so fun.

💬 Financial District, Manhattan - Liberty Street at Broadway 🗳️🏙️

Getting here plenty early at 8am seems to have paid off.

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color, ground-level, medium-angle photograph captures a dense, diverse crowd of people bundled in winter clothing, standing tightly packed on a city street waiting to enter the security screening for the mayoral inauguration in New York City today. In the foreground, individuals wear a variety of beanies, hooded parkas, and glasses, with their expressions ranging from patient to expectant. A woman in a bright pink beanie and another in a black knit hat and glasses are prominent in the lower-middle frame. The crowd fills the street, stretching back into the distance toward an intersection, creating a sea of dark coats punctuated by occasional splashes of color from hats and bags. The perspective looks down Liberty Street toward Church Street in a bustling urban environment. To the right, the sleek, dark architectural facade of the "One Liberty" building rises sharply, its glass windows reflecting the soft, cool daylight. On the left, older stone buildings house storefronts like a Burger King, while bare-branched trees decorated with small white fairy lights line the sidewalk. The clear, pale sky hangs above the narrow canyon created by the tall buildings, and a few city buses and traffic signals are visible in the far background where the crowd eventually thins.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/820/596/314/493/809/original/dd18484da5b9a3eb.jpeg)

Some creative works finally become free, but copyright is not global and rules change by country:
in New Zealand Tolkien’s books have been public domain since 2024. In Europe/US we still have to wait decades 💍

It would be nice to have one single, fair copyright law:

One law to free them all,
one law to share and bind,
one law across all nations,
and leave long waits behind.

💬 City Hall Park - Broadway at Barclay Street ❄️🏙️🗳️🥶

I arrived at the inauguration early this morning for no reason because nobody in the general public had an unobstructed view, and instead could only watch on Jumbotron.

Considering that disappointment, the single digit °F temps + wind, and needing to stand there for 2-3 hours before Mamdani even began speaking I said screw this noise lol.

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color, wide-angle photograph of the urban landscape along Broadway in front of City Hall Park in Manhattan. It is a bitter cold, and the light blue morning sky is illuminating the scene. In the foreground of the image, the dark, slate-grey stone pavers of the sidewalk appear slick and reflective, dotted with patches of melting snow and ice. A metal drainage grate is embedded in the ground to the left, and a bright yellow tactile paving strip runs horizontally across the path toward the right. The damp surface captures the pale blue light of the winter sky. Beyond a black wrought-iron fence, the skeletal branches of winter-bare trees fill the mid-ground, partially obscuring the historic buildings in the distance. A sign with white text reads “City Hall Park”. Though a Jumbotron screen is peeking through in the distance from the public inauguration of Mayor Zohran Mamdani taking place just a block away on the steps of City Hall, this corner is still.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/821/707/782/560/112/original/e5efba1b49e88ed1.jpeg)

💬 going back to TypeScript after years of almost-only-Rust is pretty brutal. [https://arktype.io/](https://arktype.io/) is pretty great but... everything being a string or a 53-bit number is anxiety-inducing

💬 Financial District - Liberty Street at Church Street 🏙️🧊

Turn the camera around from the first photo. 

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography)

![A color photograph in landscape orientation captures a wide, multi-lane street in Lower Manhattan as seen from a low-angle perspective, completely cleared of vehicle traffic and lined with metal police barricades. The asphalt is weathered with light gray patches and a double yellow line that curves slightly toward the right. In the distance, a solitary police officer stands near the center of the road facing away from the camera. Many other police officers are in small groups dispersed along the intersection with Broadway. The street is flanked by tall, modern glass skyscrapers and historic stone buildings. The barricades form a continuous silver border on both sides of the roadway. To the right, several leafless trees are wrapped in warm, glowing fairy lights. In the background, a large, iconic red cube sculpture sits at the intersection, serving as a bright focal point against the gray tones of the street. The sky above is a clear, pale blue, casting a soft, desaturated even light over the scene.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/822/098/763/330/693/original/31b4ce954f5e6e17.jpeg)

💬 I was digging around the macOS 26.2 disassembly and it appears they fixed the autofill controller resource usage issue. They also yeeted my previously found workaround (NSAutoFillHeuristicControllerEnabled), probably because too many apps disabled it.

This is probably a good thing though. It means that you can keep that undocumented setting set to workaround the earlier issues, and your app gets autofill on fixed versions. 

If you want to disable it, there are new undocumented config strings, but you can find those yourself in the disassembly :P
