💬 The third season of Tehran is the best yet. The social commentary about life in Iran has been achieved with such good writing, and is unrelated to the fictional spy craft plots. Prior seasons held my attention captive in the sense of dramatic storytelling, but the direction they’ve now taken the show has me in tears each episode 🇮🇷😭🍿

💬 Not sure why exactly I am seeing so many anti-FIFA toots the last couple days, nor do I care to know. I find it hard to believe anyone would just now be coming to the conclusion that FIFA is a terrible and corrupt organization. Look at the acquiring bids around the 2018 World Cup in Russia, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, or the dozens of people and entities who were convicted by the DOJ for facilitating nearly a quarter billion dollars in bribery schemes for the organization. There are many more similar story lines, but those are the biggest that come to mind.

GIMP 3.0.8 released today.

A  new version of the manual, including more translation work; fixes to bugs people have been kind enough to report.

Startup performance improved on many systems; colour profiles on Windows; SVG path import;
some minor UI improvements; security fixes; see link for more.

This might be the final 3.0 release before 3.2.

💬 Watching a video today on AI brain rot really helped cement for me what it is...a steady drop in practiced skills we take for granted.  If you don't occasionally write emails, you get worse at it.  if you don't do deep reading for yourself, you get worse at it.  If you don't keep drawing or coding or composing, you get worse at them.  Then the day comes when you need the skill, or something related to the skill, but you're too rusty to be effective.  And critical thinking?  Oh, that's a skill.

💬 Did you know that before the rise of LLM coding tools, programmers didn't care about the environment, and programmers didn't care about labor rights?

[https://lobste.rs/s/cw6f2s/ai_tribalism#c_m0gk3m](https://lobste.rs/s/cw6f2s/ai_tribalism#c_m0gk3m)

When being called on it, he backed down to saying this only applies to "some" programmers. But that just devolves to dismissing anyone who took longer to realize they need to care more about the world. In either case, engaging with the critique is unnecessary: these people don't exist, or don't matter.

💬 AOC 2025 day 3 is when I start to realize that my usual tool sets in [#Pascal](https://techhub.social/tags/Pascal) or [#Go](https://techhub.social/tags/Go) have a lot of string handling functions that I just don't see in [#Forth](https://techhub.social/tags/Forth). I'm building up some tools and have a few competing versions of tfunctions that either take different approaches, use different parameter formats, and/or return formats. But I don't want to re-implement the left, right, mid string functions without being sure that's the way to go.

I'm getting a lot of "off by one" errors.

Some are caused by my Pascal "it's a subscript, damn it" bias, and others by not using the right looping constructs.

Strings in Forth are a beginning address and a length. The length can be a maximum size available or the length of the current string. There's no dynamism here, nothing like AnsiStrings in [#FreePascal](https://techhub.social/tags/FreePascal). There are some conventional buffers that the standard definitions will not touch (the PAD) and other transient buffers that can be used with care.

'Tis what I signed up for. It's fun. Kinda. :)

The vehicle is heavily blanketed in a thick layer of fresh snow which covers the roof, the hood, and most of the side windows. The iconic black "NYC T" taxi emblem is clearly visible on the driver’s side door, alongside smaller black icons indicating metered fares and flat rates to JFK. Large, multi-spoke silver and black rims peek out from beneath the wheel wells, contrasted against the dark asphalt of the road and the accumulating snow on the ground. A digital advertisement board is mounted to the roof and turned off. The background is a hazy, urban setting obscured by thick, falling snowflakes. A white van is parked directly behind the taxi, and the dark brick facade of a building is behind the van.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/956/080/281/831/379/original/e02d4c45b62faeba.jpeg)

Thick, fresh snow blankets the stone steps, though a narrow path in the center has been partially cleared by foot traffic and wind, revealing the dark treads beneath. To the right, a high concrete retaining wall is covered in vibrant red, white, and black graffiti, providing a sharp urban contrast to the soft white snow. On the left, a dark, leafless hedge and fence line runs parallel to the stairs. Metal handrails with a jagged, geometric design frame both sides of the staircase, disappearing upward into the heavy snowfall. The atmosphere is quiet and wintry, with large, visible snowflakes filling the air and softening the focus of the background. At the top of the long climb, the silhouette of a city building is faintly visible through the gray, overcast mist, emphasizing the steepness of the incline. Visibility is greatly reduced. The color palette is dominated by the cool blues and whites of the snow and the monochromatic tones of the city, punctuated only by the bold pops of color from the street art on the right.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/956/651/373/445/062/original/3a6617a14d6ff5b9.jpeg)

💬 T-Mobile’s ‘T-Life’ app is 650MB, not counting data cache from using it. Why the hell is it so large? My guess is their iOS devs find they need some small bit of functionality, and rather than writing it themselves they just install a library here, another library there, and before you know it your app bundle is an unnecessarily bloated mess. 📱👨🏻‍💻

💬 I’ve been building goxe, a Go tool to stop log spam and cut cloud costs. It collapses thousands of repeated logs into a single line with a counter.

Just released v0.9.0 with burst detection.

💬 [@Jamessocol](https://indieweb.social/@Jamessocol) [@b0rk](https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk) We put a huge emphasis on docs from day 1. Our policy has always been that new code can’t be merged unless it includes docs — we’ve held up major features because the docs weren’t done/good. That’s a virtuous cycle: good docs attract contributors who value good docs. So yeah it’s super intentional, and always nice to hear from someone that it seems to be working :)

![A color, medium-angle photograph in landscape orientation that captures an updated profile view of the bright yellow New York City taxi SUV parked on a street from the previous photo in this thread. The taxi is now partially buried after a significant amount of snowfall. The heavy, wind-sculpted snow from the peak remains piled high against the lower half of the vehicle, halfway obscuring the tires. A thick, white crust of snow still clings to the roof and hood, drooping over the tops of the windows in frozen, jagged edges. The iconic black "NYC T" medallion logo is centered on the front door, with the taxi’s identification number "7C98" visible toward the rear. The atmosphere has transitioned to a lighter snowfall, with smaller, more sparse flakes visible against the backdrop of a red brick building. The air appears clearer and the visibility has improved compared to earlier, revealing more detail in the surrounding urban environment, such as the windows of the building and a white van parked in the distance.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/957/827/512/561/685/original/1ca76c3894d75fc8.jpeg)

💬 Something I noticed lately is people having at least separate sections on their website if not a separate site entirely to split blog posts/articles from short thoughts/social media posts. Do people like that for the separate RSS feeds so you can ignore the short stuff? Hate it because now it's 2 feeds to follow if you wants everything from someone? Don't care since it all just funnels into a single place here and you don't use RSS feeds?

💬 [@brettcannon](https://mastodon.social/@brettcannon) I'm going to resolve mine soon. Mine was mostly Micro Blog being easier to blog with than Jekyll. I'm moving both back to Django, but I had about 50 other thing son my plate to clear out. 

To your question, I prefer a unified feed regardless of how many sources people have.
