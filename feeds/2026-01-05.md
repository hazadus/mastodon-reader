💬 Of course, for fun I pointed Gemini at the Django source and asked it to find the slowest parts of the request/response cycle and optimize it.

So… you know, I'm part of the problem I guess.

💬 So it turns out that I cannot set a custom path for tools (e.g., go) that Zed IDE uses.

No. It's not exposed through settings.
No. Neither in settings.json.

So basically Zed in Flatpak cannot use gopls (Golang language server). Back to Codium.

💬 Washington Heights, Manhattan - Cabrini Boulevard

![A color, medium-angle photograph in square aspect ratio. An eye-level shot that captures a weathered stone staircase leading up to a grand, arched doorway set into a rustic stone wall. The steps are wide and made of grey, rectangular stone slabs, scattered with dried brown leaves and debris, indicating the winter setting. Flanking the stairs are thick, angled concrete banisters in a muted brownish-mauve tone, which show signs of peeling paint and wear. The overall color palette is earthy and desaturated, dominated by shades of tan, brown, and grey. At the top of the stairs, a heavy metal door is recessed into a deep archway framed by prominent, rusticated stone blocks. The door is covered in white graffiti tags, most notably the letters "BS" and "BACKSEE." To either side of the central arch, the wall features large, rectangular decorative panels made of horizontal stone courses, creating a sense of classical architectural order despite the structure's weathered and neglected state. A thin metal pipe runs vertically along the wall to the right of the door, and a few dry, leafless branches peek over the top of the right-hand banister.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/839/810/010/146/480/original/4133826b8831479a.jpeg)

💬 My discrete event simulation of a small software team ([https://gvwilson.github.io/sim/](https://gvwilson.github.io/sim/)) implicitly assumes that (to borrow a phrase from [@grimalkina](https://mastodon.social/@grimalkina)) programmers are just brains in jars.

💬 CES starts on Tuesday, and I always look forward to seeing the absolutely ridiculous vaporware companies show off. AI and robotics will undoubtedly be the main theme this year. Quite a few companies use the event to launch actual shipping products though.

I attended the show in 2016 and the focus was on VR headsets/accessories, and smart wearable tech like smart socks, headbands, other clothing. It was a couple months after the 6S Plus was released and I remember there were rose gold iPhones all over the place lol.

That one experience was enough for me. I walked no less than 13 km per day, crowds at the most popular booths meant a lot of standing around, and I got sick as hell the morning l left Vegas to head home.

💬 Picking this back up after a 6-8 month hiatus, I'm going to try and document some of my reading material as I wend my way through this learning process. 

Starting around Xmas, I've re-read some of the official Go documentation and some of the tutorials. Installed and got the vim-go plugin([https://github.com/fatih/vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go)) configured, for now. Seems pretty well-maintained for my current needs. 

I've also ported a couple of my brain-dead python & bash utilities over to golang without much struggle, which is encouraging.

Aside from the official documentation & blogs, I've settled on two books to use as training wheels to get me started:

Learning Go: An Idiomatic Approach to Real-World Go Programming [2024] by Jon Bodner
[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go-2nd/9781098139285/)

Introducing Go[2016] by Caleb Doxsey
[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-go/9781491941997/titlepage01.html](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-go/9781491941997/titlepage01.html)

At this point, "Introducing Go" seems a lot more introductory and hand-holdy. Which is fine for me while I get my motivation ramped up. More simple examples and exercises.

I'll probably be referencing them frequently while I convert & break my existing scripts/utilities.

💬 From the Golang blog [2011] Go Slices: usage and internals

Found this helpful and provides some info on internals. A bit above my pay-grade, for the moment; but, will lead me into digging deeper into some of the Effective Go documentation when I'm ready.

[https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro](https://go.dev/blog/slices-intro)

Side note: Wish there was a better way to browse the blog [#Documentation](https://hachyderm.io/tags/Documentation). Seems there is a lot of potentially useful stuff buried in there.

💬 At this point, I think I'm satisfied with the vim-go plugin providing me with a stoopid simple template for prototyping very basic example programs.

It's definitely not a [#REPL](https://hachyderm.io/tags/REPL) like I'm used to with [#Python](https://hachyderm.io/tags/Python) or running from the [#CLI](https://hachyderm.io/tags/CLI); but, it's a bit of a useful workflow to get started. *shrug*

💬 🧵 We moved from Google Cloud to Hetzner and cut infrastructure costs by 80%. Here's what I learned:

Same workloads, same reliability, actually better performance for our use case. Main thing we lost: 47 GCP console screens to find a simple setting.

GCP isn't bad - it's powerful and right for many cases. But somewhere the industry decided "real" companies must use hyperscalers. That's marketing, not engineering.

Django now includes a built-in Tasks framework for running code outside the HTTP request–response cycle. 

This enables offloading work, such as sending emails or processing data, to background workers.

The framework provides task definition, validation, queuing, and result handling. 

Django guarantees consistent behavior for creating and managing tasks, while the responsibility for running them continues to belong to external worker processes.

buggy and very beta, use at your own risk

Minty is a fresh, ultra-concise, type-safe HTML generation library for responsive Go web applications. It provides a fluent API for creating HTML components without traditional templates, offering compile-time safety and excellent IDE support.

The code examples are fresh, the documentation is very out of sync. Will be working on that soon.

💬 New coins begin to circulate today, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. but all of the ones approved by a committee were trashed by the treasury secretary. So instead, aside from three featuring presidents, there will be this one of two pilgrims.

Originally they were to feature Frederick Douglass, to mark the abolition of slavery. Another would highlight the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. A third coin would have shown 6-year-old Ruby Bridges, to celebrate school desegregation and the civil rights movement.

[#USPol](https://typo.social/tags/USPol) [#History](https://typo.social/tags/History)

![The first of the new anniversary quarters features the Mayflower Compact. 

• Central Imagery: The coin depicts two Pilgrims—a man and a woman—standing together. The man is wearing a traditional wide-brimmed hat and a doublet with a prominent collar, while the woman wears a traditional coif (cap). They are shown in a moment of connection, with their hands clasped and the man's hand resting protectively on the woman's shoulder as they "behold the New World."
• Inscriptions:
• E PLURIBUS UNUM: Located at the top along the rim.
• IN GOD WE TRUST: Located at the bottom along the rim.
• 1776 ~ 2026: The dual dates representing the 250-year anniversary are prominently featured in the lower center.
• Artist Marks: You can see the initials "RS" (for designer Ronald D. Sanders) on the left and "EC" (for sculptor Eric David Custer) on the right. The "D" above the right initials indicates this specific coin was minted in Denver.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/843/876/603/912/935/original/06cb43fc9b1cdaa4.png)

Express UI ideas in JSX. Ship them in Go.

reminty converts React/JSX components to Go + minty, letting web developers be productive immediately while learning Go naturally through the code they ship.  Think of it as less than a transpiler, more like an accelerator and little wheels, with compilable Go code on day one 
[https://github.com/ha1tch/reminty/tree/main](https://github.com/ha1tch/reminty/tree/main)

Most trivial to medium-high complexity cases are most often straightforward to translate. For the most complex cases, you still get 80% of the work done, with TODOs and code comments explaining what needs to be manually added or corrected.

The reminty output is meant to be used together with minty

💬 [@glyph](https://mastodon.social/@glyph) on a totally different note, thanks for sharing that video about kratom addiction. It was good, and I can’t help but think that if my friend had seen it last year it could have helped push him down a different path.

💬 Lunar New Year transitioning to year of the horse is about a month away. It always trips me up, and I guarantee I will still be writing year of the snake on my checks until like April. 🐴🎊

💬 I am really pleased with how good SBCL and CCL [#CommonLisp](https://merveilles.town/tags/CommonLisp) compilers format code. They don't have console flags for code formatting or whatever [#Rust](https://merveilles.town/tags/Rust) or [#Go](https://merveilles.town/tags/Go) might do, but the standard "write" function with flags like ":pretty t :right-margin 80 :escape t :readably t :case :downcase" is surprisingly good at producing human-readable code listings! 

I might even go as far as making a really thin CLI tool wrapping SBCL (or CCL, didn't benchmark them against each other in that) code printing. It wouldn't be a proper code formatter, because it wouldn't handle e.g. reader macros and special (backquote, dot) syntax, but it'd be quite enough for simple cases!

💬 The most succinct and accurate description of the Old Web I’ve seen to date.

![The old web isn’t a platform, an aesthetic, or a technology. The old web is people creating and sharing because they are intrinsically motivated. Everything we hate about the current web comes from extrinsic motivations. Good luck removing them.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/267/349/579/967/117/original/083e131bcbdc1177.jpeg)
