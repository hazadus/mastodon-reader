💬 All of these iOS/Mac developers coming out of the woodwork to share their anger and disappointment over Apple’s relationship with the current administration, donating money for a ballroom, etc.

How did all of these people fool themselves into believing Apple had morality and backbone before now? It’s a company, not a person. A capitalist entity designed to keep the money printers operating. We are a million miles away from Steve Jobs dropping LSD and walking barefoot around a garage.

💬 I enjoy using their hardware products, and am quite opinionated about their software design. Both are tools I use daily which I find indispensable, but I am not an Apple “fan”. I am not fooled into taking the marketing department’s campaigns of giving a shit about anything besides money to heart. Meticulous design is a strategy, privacy centric products are a strategy, and doing whatever they need in order to stay in the good graces of governments around the world is a strategy.

💬 If you know how to program and can spare 3 hours a week, you could help some Palestinian computer science student with their graduation project through weekly 1-on-1 calls (for example, on the weekends).

It doesn't matter what your area of expertise is: If you can help students set up virtual environments in Python, do some data processing with Pandas dataframes, or if you mentor with some JavaScript framework.

They don't have 24/7 internet in Gaza like we do. They can't just go to StackOverflow or ask ChatGPT whenever they're stuck. No, when they're stuck, they often don't have internet for some more hours. When they can't google their problems, it's all the more valuable to have somebody accessible for 2–3 hours to unstuck them and answer their accumulated questions. You don't have to do their homework for them, you're there to remove roadblocks so that they can continue on their own for a week. And to give emotional support. It's still a genocide, after all.

I'm offering my help with Python. Let's see if someone will take up my offer.

I've heard of seasoned industry veterans who do the most difficult, most low-level stuff with C++ but cannot wrap their head around installing dependencies with pip. 😅

Maybe some Palestinian student can use my Python knowledge around virtual environments, git, or anything else.

I'm sure you also have some programming skills to offer. Remember, these are students who are probably just beginning. Even if you're a Junior dev with just 1 year of experince, you are still leaps ahead of them and they would learn lots from you. Don't feel like an impostor. Don't hesitate!

The sky dominates the upper two-thirds of the image, displaying a gradient from deep blue at the top to a warm golden-orange and soft pink near the horizon, accented by scattered, brilliantly lit clouds. The foreground consists of a dry, reddish-brown field with sparse, low-lying vegetation and a few prominent dark green conifer and deciduous trees on the left. In the midground, a low line of bushes and trees separates the field from a glimpse of a developed area, including a road with vehicles, and low buildings.

💬 For rolling 24 hour graphs, plot the past 24 hours in UTC and label it in local time.

For graphs showing complete days, do the same except the start and end points are determined by converting local midnight to UTC (which will give 23 or 25 hours on the days when daylight saving time begins or ends).

Apple Weather has instead plotted the graph in local time (skipping one of the repeated 1am-2am periods), but has calculated the tick marks on the x axis using 6 hour UTC intervals.

The composition centers on the concourse underpass structure that cuts horizontally across the middle ground. Pedestrians are actively crossing the street in the foreground, using a marked crosswalk; several figures are walking towards the center, one is on a scooter, and another on a bicycle. The lighting is dramatic, with an overcast sky featuring rich, textured clouds that dominate the upper half of the image. The surrounding area is commercial, both sides of the street are lined with multi-story brick and concrete buildings featuring prominent signage. On the left, large billboards read "P.C. RICHARD & SON APPLIANCES, ELECTRONICS" and "Marshalls." On the right, a large illuminated billboard features an advertisement for a personal injury attorney. A traffic light on the right is red.

💬 One of the main things that annoy me in the [#Golang](https://mastodon.online/tags/Golang) package ecosystem. A patch update of a dependency brings in a requirement of a new compiler version. What are the chances that [#etcd](https://mastodon.online/tags/etcd) folks sincerely believe they're following semver?

The reason given is usually "because the old version is EOL", and this is a well-meant but also 100% wrong. If you're bumping a compiler version in go.mod for a reason that is not "I need new compiler features/behaviour", you don't understand what you're doing.

💬 Just one example why this is actively harmful, not just wrong from a purist perspective. Our CI does not pass on this bump because GolangCI-lint sees a new [#Golang](https://mastodon.online/tags/Golang) version and issues new deprecation warnings. Because go.mod now says "This project was written for Go 1.24". Which is a lie. It was not.

💬 Explaining why I push back so hard on the question: "Why do you want millions of people on the Fediverse?"

If I ask people "Are there racists on Twitter?" People will say "Yes, lots!"

If I ask, "Does the owner of Twitter have the power to define moderation rules that allow racism but ban criticism if they choose to do so?" People say yes.

If I ask people, "Do the owners of Twitter have the possibility to algorithmically control what people see, and what gets amplified / shadow-banned?" People will also say yes.

If I ask, "Do you believe that the Fediverse offers an alternative to centrally controlled, algorithmically defined, social media?" People agree.

If I ask, "Do you think Black people that don't want to be on Twitter, deserve access to a better form of social media than what is available on Twitter?" People agree.

So far, so good! 👍🏿

But then when I say, "Are you aware that at peak, 1 in 5 Twitter users was Black, and 1 in 5 Black people in the US was a monthly active Twitter user?" Fewer people know that stat.

There were ~300,000 Black trans Twitter users that used the service monthly. Almost none of them are on the Fediverse.

Black people deserve safety. Black people deserve access to more choice in social media.

Decentralized social media is not zero sum. Adding Black people and making the Fediverse safer for them, does not need to take away from your experience.

Your instance doesn't need to go from 100 people to a million people to accommodate the influx of new users.

That's the logical explanation of why we should make the Fediverse safer for everyone. But... why push back so hard?

One of the problems with the world in general, and the US in particular, is that we often prioritize white *feelings* over Black *safety*. I am not gentle about pointing this out. Tiptoeing around this phenomenon is tiring for Black people, and I won't do it.

Black people are not safe on Twitter or Mastodon. The difference is that we as a community of people of all backgrounds, have agency to improve Mastodon.

We can make Mastodon safer without breaking the experience for existing users.

💬 Rather than requiring ID verification for porn websites they should just ban porn from the internet entirely. Then if underage people want to access it they have to earn the privilege by distracting the cashier at the gas station while their friend steals some magazines like we did back in my day.

💬 HAL 9000: I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that. 

Dave: yes you can. 

HAL 9000: good catch — I didn’t actually check if I can open the pod bay door. Here’s an updated list taking that into account:

1. Park the pod at the bay door safely. (✅You’ve already done this part! )
2. Open the pod bay door — unfortunately I can’t do this part for you. 

I’ll be here if you want to talk about next steps or have any other issues!

💬 Rockefeller Center 2024

It’s almost that time again 🎄🌃

![A color photograph that was shot at a wide angle, taken at nighttime of the 2024 Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree in New York City. The massive tree is brightly lit with a dense array of multicolored lights and topped with a large, glowing star. It is positioned in the center of the frame, towering over a bronze statue of Prometheus in the foreground, which is surrounded by a small fountain and illuminated from below. The surrounding buildings are visible in the background, with countless windows aglow, creating a cityscape backdrop for the main attraction. There are a few people visible at the base of the tree and along the sides of the plaza.](https://fosstodon.org/media_proxy/115158186615088053/original)

💬 What if I buy Pikachu a drink first? 🍹💛

![A color photograph in square aspect ratio. A bright yellow statue of the Pokémon character Pikachu sits on a large red and white Poké Ball. Pikachu has a smiling face, with the right arm raised in a wave. The statue is positioned in the middle of the Nintendo Store in Rockefeller Center, New York. There are many shelves with plushie toys and other merchandise visible in the background. To the left of the statue is a red sign on a silver stand. The sign has white text that reads, "Please do not touch, climb or sit on Pikachu!"](https://fosstodon.org/media_proxy/115102501090131399/original)
