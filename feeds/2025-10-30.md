💬 The US government shutdown has made my job a little less certain.

I work as a civilian contractor for the US Department of Defense. I'm employed by a company called Oteemo and they have the DOD contract that I'm on.

My contract was supposed to be until next May, but apparently, they can decide to just cancel the contract in the middle, and that's what they decided to do, because I'm a programmer and not a soldier.

I'm not out of a job. I'm still employed by Oteemo, and they'll put me on deck until they renew the contract. So I'm not currently in any financial trouble or anything.

But, if this drags on, Oteemo could decide they don't want me for a different contract and let me go. So, I'm looking for something new. I want to get ahead of this and not be out of work right now.

I'm a full-stack or back-end web developer with over twenty years of professional experience. I've mostly worked in go and PHP, but I'm also good in Python, and can learn anything else. I've also done some basic DevOps.

I've worked as a Team Lead and Senior Architect. In the last few years, my work has focused on microservices.

I'm looking for something based in the US, but remote. I'd be open to in office on the Southwest side of Houston, TX (Sugar Land would be better).

I might consider relocation to another country, but it would have to be a warm climate and a safe place for kids with access to an international school.

I have a [résumé](https://danielrayjones.com/web/) and a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danjones000/), and will update them both soon.

Please feel free to DM me, email, [IM on Jabber](xmpp://danjones000@conversations.im), or just call/text if you have any leads. And I'd appreciate it if you'd boost this for visibility.

![At small scale, these systems hurt you more than
they benefit you. Distributed systems - both in
terms of node count and system cardinality -
should be respected, feared, avoided and em-
ployed only as a weapon of last resort against par-
ticularly gnarly problems. Everything with a dis-
tributed system becomes more challenging and
time-consuming.
The problem is the organizational overhead.
The organizational overhead of adopting a new
system, learning its nuances, configs, establishing
monitoring, establishing processes around deploy-
ments and upgrades, attaining operational exper-
tise on how to manage it, creating runbooks, test-
ing it, debugging it, adopting its clients and API,
using its Ul, keeping up with its ecosystem, etc.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/460/593/754/099/478/original/d8963feccf931dad.png)

![MVI (a better alternative)
What I think is a better approach is to search for
the minimum viable infrastructure (MVI): build
the smallest amount of system while still providing
value.
1. choose good-enough technology your org
is already familiar with
• good-enough == meets your users'
needs without being too slow/expen-
sive/insecure
• familiar == your org has prior experi-
ence, has runbooks/ops setups, moni-
toring, Ul, etc
2. solve a real problem with it
3. use the minimum set of features
• the fewer features you use, the more
flexibility you have to move off the infra
in question in the future (e.g if locked
in with a vendor)
Bonus points if that technology:
• is widely adopted so finding good engineers
for it is trivial (Postgres - check)
• has a strong and growing network effect
(Postgres - check)](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/460/593/828/752/679/original/f9322c1fbba97282.png)

💬 Maybe my view is outdated given I haven’t used any other social networking services for many years, but I feel like people on fedi are much more open about themselves, feelings, and their lives in general than elsewhere. Is it because the network overall is much smaller? The integration of content warnings that make it easy for people to filter and mute triggers? The large LGBT community leading to people feeling safer to share? Whatever it is it sure is nice. 🌎🕸️👨🏻‍💻

💬 What is the best way to run/install an NPM package as a tool that I run from the command-line globally? E.g. `netlify-cli` or `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` where I don't have a `node_modules` directory where I want to run the tool (there are other tools, so don't consider this exhaustive)..

I tried using `npm install -g`, but the fact that running `npm update -g` tells me it changed umpteen files no matter how many times I run the command successively suggests it isn't working the way I expect.

💬 🌘 iommi：Django 的生產力工具，快速打造複雜後端介面
➤ 告別樣板程式碼，用 Python 宣告式地打造 Django 介面
✤ [https://iommi.rocks/](https://iommi.rocks/)
iommi 是一個專為 Django 設計的生產力工具組，能讓開發者無需編寫大量樣板程式碼，即可快速建立表單、表格、頁面乃至管理後臺等複雜的用戶介面。它強調透過 Python 宣告式地定義元件，自動生成介面，並提供高度的彈性供開發者客製化，有效提升開發效率，減少重複性程式碼，讓開發者專注於核心業務邏輯。
+ 這個工具聽起來很有潛力！減少樣板程式碼確實是 Django 開發中的一大痛點，希望能看到更多實際應用案例。
+ 對於需要快速迭代後端介面的專案來說，iommi 似乎是一個不錯的選擇。其自動生成功能和客製化的靈活性值得關注。

💬 Just quoting myself from 2020: 

"Inevitably we got round to talking about async.

As much of an unneeded complication as it is for so many day-to-day use-cases, it’s important for Python because, if and when you do need the high throughput handling of these io-bound use-cases, you don’t want to have to switch language.

The same for Django: most of what you’re doing has no need of async but you don’t want to have to change web framework just because you need a sprinkling of non-blocking IO"

💬 Шаблоны и принципы деления кода на классы

За 9 лет разработки ПО я периодически выступал в роли ментора и сталкивался с проблемой, которую недавно озвучил начинающий программист после онлайн-курсов: «Не понимаю, как делить код на классы». Оказалось, на курсах учили языку, но не программированию. А ведь язык — лишь инструмент, и принципы проектирования кода универсальны для разных языков программирования. Я показал студенту несколько готовых шаблонов классов, чтобы он мог сразу применить, и хотел дать методичку по теории, но под рукой не оказалось ни заметок, ни статей, ни книг. Поиск в интернете и запросы к ИИ выдавали только материалы по ООП и принципам SOLID, которые мало касались нужной темы. Выходило так, что вся нужная для такой методички информация, лежит у меня в голове. Так и родилась идея написать эту статью.

💬 Hey, Anthropic owes me $9000!    They illegally used at least 3 of my books on LibGen to create Claude.   Now they're paying a $1.5 billion settlement, at $3000 per book.  See if *your* books are on the list:

[https://www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com/](https://www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com/)

If so, you have until March 23, 2026 to file a claim.   The above website lets you file a claim, but this one explains everything more clearly:

[https://authorsguild.org/advocacy/artificial-intelligence/what-authors-need-to-know-about-the-anthropic-settlement/#next-steps](https://authorsguild.org/advocacy/artificial-intelligence/what-authors-need-to-know-about-the-anthropic-settlement/#next-steps)

Actually I exaggerated: the payment will be split between authors and publishers, but I have to make the claim - so the settlement is making me do some work my publisher should be doing for me.   My coauthors and I will just get half, $4500.  One of these books has 2 coauthors, one has 3, and one is a book I edited, with essays by lots of authors.  So $1000 is a more realistic estimate of what I get.   Oh well.

Bizarrely, my most popular book, Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity, is not on the list.  But I guess it's not surprising: 

"The settlement agreement discloses that approximately 500,000 titles out of the 7 million copies of books that Anthropic reportedly downloaded from LibGen and PiLiMi meet the definition required to be part of the class."

Only books whose copyright is registered with the US Library of Congress meet that defiinition!

If you have a book on the list, you can opt out of the current settlement and join future lawsuits.  But you have to take action to do that!!!   For more information on that, see item 40 here:

💬 Did any [#Go](https://metalhead.club/tags/Go) developers need code to get a zero value of a struct but without knowing the layout of the struct itself? 

The only thing I could come up with was: 

func zero[T any](v T) T {
	z := &v
	zz := reflect.ValueOf(z).Elem()
	zz.Set(reflect.Zero(reflect.TypeOf(v)))
	return *z
}

And see here an example of usage: [https://go.dev/play/p/Aqzc_nRzOcP](https://go.dev/play/p/Aqzc_nRzOcP)

I needed it in order to get zero copies of random structs so I could test that  some marshal/unmarshal functionality is a bijection.

Is this a decent way to do it? Are there alternatives?

I think [@bmispelon](https://mastodon.social/@bmispelon) 's upcliff example is a better path. 

Just do what Python does instead of requiring people to write custom templatetags for fundamental mechanics that Python does. 

I think we make it harder than it needs to be and I know 20 years... but if we are going to set a new goal post, I'd rather it applies to Python basics.

💬 [@carlton](https://chaos.social/@carlton) [@CodenameTim](https://mastodon.social/@CodenameTim) [@bmispelon](https://mastodon.social/@bmispelon) DTL + letting us access dicts the way Python already does isn’t asking for something new; it’s asking for something natural.

Given DTL’s roots in PHP’s Smarty, I think a lot more was copied than deliberately designed in those early days, and that’s fine. But needing to write a custom template tag for something as basic as dictionary access doesn’t feel like a feature; it feels like an opportunity for improvement.

A |get tag is three lines. In my view, that you have to write it is good! It makes you consider your data and stops you slipping business logic into the template. That discipline is why I continue to choose the DTL over other options. 

No way would it just be dictionary access. It would be function application and all the rest of it too. No thank you. 🙃

Django signals are extremely useful for decoupling modules and implementing complicated workflows. However, the underlying transport for signals makes them unreliable and subject to unexpected failures.

In this article, I present an alternative transport implementation for Django signals using background tasks which makes them reliable and safer to use in mission critical workflows.

I've wished for a `|get` filter so many times. SO MANY! And proper string concatenation (i.e. a `|add` that really works with strings).

I fully agree these belong in [#Django](https://fosstodon.org/tags/Django) built-in template filter set.

And I disagree that writing a custom template tag is simple: you need the folder, the `__init__.py`, pick a name (always the hardest part), remember imports and syntax...

By the time you’re done, you’ve forgotten what you were trying to do. 😅

As soon as you have a library module set up it’s trivial to add more. (And more important, it’s trivial to test **tags**). If folks aren’t writing tags over that they’re really missing out. 

Maybe we can add a small number of more tags. My belief is that we serve people better by helping them to write their own. Enable.

Yeah, I totally get that point, thought I don’t think `templatetags/` should be there by default. Out of all the Django projects I've worked on, maybe 1 in 10 actually had that folder.

I'd be *fully* on board with an audit of the default filters though. Every time I go looking for `|get`, I stumble upon things like `|divisibleby`, `|get_digit`, or `|widthratio`. I mean... we have DIVISIBLE BY but not GET? Absolutely infuriating! 🤡

💬 Hey, Anthropic owes me $9000!    They illegally used at least 3 of my books on LibGen to create Claude.   Now they're paying a $1.5 billion settlement, at $3000 per book.  See if *your* books are on the list:

[https://www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com/](https://www.anthropiccopyrightsettlement.com/)

If so, you have until March 23, 2026 to file a claim.   The above website lets you file a claim, but this one explains everything more clearly:

[https://authorsguild.org/advocacy/artificial-intelligence/what-authors-need-to-know-about-the-anthropic-settlement/#next-steps](https://authorsguild.org/advocacy/artificial-intelligence/what-authors-need-to-know-about-the-anthropic-settlement/#next-steps)

Actually I exaggerated: the payment will be split between authors and publishers, but I have to make the claim - so the settlement is making me do some work my publisher should be doing for me.   My coauthors and I will just get half, $4500.  One of these books has 2 coauthors, one has 3, and one is a book I edited, with essays by lots of authors.  So $1000 is a more realistic estimate of what I get.   Oh well.

Bizarrely, my most popular book, Gauge Fields, Knots and Gravity, is not on the list.  But I guess it's not surprising: 

"The settlement agreement discloses that approximately 500,000 titles out of the 7 million copies of books that Anthropic reportedly downloaded from LibGen and PiLiMi meet the definition required to be part of the class."

Only books whose copyright is registered with the US Library of Congress meet that defiinition!

If you have a book on the list, you can opt out of the current settlement and join future lawsuits.  But you have to take action to do that!!!   For more information on that, see item 40 here:

💬 At the end of June of this year, the Democratic National Committee reported it had USD$15.2 million cash on hand. That's million with an "m".

The annual budget for the SNAP program is approximately USD$100 billion. That's billion with a "b". Over six thousand times as much money as the DNC had on hand at the end of June.

When someone tells you the DNC could just use its money to set up a SNAP replacement, I pray you will not take them seriously.

💬 This is related to the stats I sometimes have to trot out when people claim we could get all the social programs we'd like if we just "tax billionaires".

Back in the early Biden days I ran the numbers and found that If you could have somehow rounded up the entire Forbes 400 list, and could have confiscated and liquidated their entire net worth at face value, you would have collected enough money to run the current US Medicare system (for people 65+ or disabled) for... about two and a half years.

Social safety nets are good and we should do more of them, but they are expensive on a level that makes even mega-billionaires look poor, and the main obstacle to them in the United States is simply that people are unwilling to bear the tax burden no matter how many good arguments you have for why they should.

💬 Ghostty on macOS now copies multiple formats into the clipboard. If you paste into rich text apps now, it'll preserve formatting! If you paste plain text, that'll work too. I think Ghostty may be the only macOS terminal other than the built-in to do this. I would've expected iTerm2to do this but it doesn't (at least not by default)... Coming soon to GTK, too.

💬 Hi folks.

I am officially not teaching a University class in the winter. So I am considering running a Python class in Q1 for tech workers who want to learn Python. I'm gauging interest.

Ten week run. Weekly cadence. 2.5-3 hour remote sessions via Zoom. Homework available but optional (although I would strongly recommend the reading bit, ~30-90 minutes per week).

Do reply here or email me (firstname at firstname lastname dot com) if interested :)
