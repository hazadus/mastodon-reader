💬 It's like every single person who looked at the Cloudflare blog post read exactly zero words of it, scrolled down 20 screens to the code sample, and drew the same stupid conclusion. I don't claim Rust's error handling story is the best, but blaming unwrap() is beyond silly.

This is a situation where

invalid configuration was producedand deployed worldwideand the system couldn't copeReasonable lessons to learn are:

maybe don't produce bad configdefinitely don't deploy it worldwideif possible, make your system copeBad configuration is a recurring cause of these cloud system outages. It is absolutely true that Rust is not immune. But grepping for unwrap in your code is kind of a dumb response to this news, and retroactively never having unwrap wouldn't have made Rust more reliable. You might as well pass a law banning unpleasant surprises. We have to be smarter than that and look for ways to engineer better error handling.

💬 Worth noting with Mastodon - one of the reasons for no cookie consent popup is.. there are no tracking cookies.  At all.  

Similar with official mobile apps, there's no privacy agreements etc in the app stores as there's no third party tracking.

Why is this notable?  Try doing the same check on Facebook, X, Instagram, Threads, Bluesky or basically anywhere or anything else online.  It's basically unheard of in 2025, as everybody else is selling you.

💬 After the recent Rubygems drama, I felt anxious, and trapped, frustrated that I can’t escape evil people trying to dominate my life.

I found myself grieving, and mourning the future I grew up thinking we would have; but also feeling hope, that it’s not too late to stop enabling these people, and start choosing kindness.

I wrote about these feelings. Join me in building a better future:

💬 The re-release of old episodes just to sell advertising spots, and new show cross promotions from celebrity hosted podcasts are beyond annoying, and one of the top reasons I don’t subscribe to any of them. Adding a feature to a podcast app to hide them is beyond smart. 🎙️👨🏻‍💻

💬 It is quite unusual for the December timeframe .2 iPadOS releases each year to include major feature additions and overhauls, but that is exactly what we’re seeing this year. In hindsight I don’t believe Apple is walking back a purposeful removal of slide over and split view multitasking. Rather the Liquid Glass and new windowing interface additions put the engineering team behind schedule, and we are now seeing them catching up to delayed internal milestones. ⚙️👨🏻‍💻

💬 like, consider open source projects. casual code review works because you assume the code is written by a human and you presume that person is taking pride in their work. if you prompt a spambot to emit maximum PRs under your name so you can pad out your resume and land one of the 7 remaining jobs at FAANG, to stand out among the 5,000 applicants for every opening, the reviewer has no chance. they can't possibly contend with that volume of junk. projects will shut down, eventually.

💬 so you have to be equally vigilant on every single line of code, which is way harder than you think (even if you already know that it's pretty hard). and you have to exercise that level of vigilance *because* the contributor didn't care enough to pay attention to the code themselves. it is a recipe for burnout.

Что внутри: Теория: GC, планировщик, модель памяти - минимум для понимания проблемы Практика: pprof профили всех типов (heap, goroutine, allocs, block) Инструментарий: как читать дампы горутин и системную диагностику Готовые скрипты для воспроизведения и анализа утечек Runtime tracing для сложных случаев Реальный пример из статьи: Зависшие горутины в одном месте -> stw паузы выросли с 1ms до 50ms -> api деградировал. Статья построена как практическое руководство с минимумом теории и максимумом применимых техник. Во второй части - конкретные примеры утечек с кодом, production-кейс и настройка мониторинга. Для тех, кто хочет научиться находить утечки ДО того, как они попадут в prod.

💬 Just read an article detailing how Microsoft executives are confused and upset that people don't appreciate their AI features and don't like people giving them shit about them on Twitter.  "How are people not impressed with this stuff?"

Fellas, have you used the internet lately? It's fucked. Have you used Windows? Fucked. It's shit. People are sick of it being shit, because it didn't used to be as shit as this.  You've gone and fucked everything, that's why people aren't happy with you.

💬 So what are the career options for a senior engineer in the IT industry that avoid AI entirely in 2025?

I'm tired, boss. Tired of keeping my mouth closed about it at work. Tired of waking up angry that my employer and industry at large are:

* Pushing hard to adopt an absolute crap technology with very low accuracy and consistency, which additionally has had noticeable affects on certain co-workers ability to understand a problem and picture the solution (those who seem to be offloading their thinking to AI over the last year have notably degraded in these areas)
* Supporting the enrichment of billionaire fascists who want to manipulate and control the truth and control the population to make themselves richer.
* Supporting the re-ignition of coal power plants and burning significant amounts of power and water to fuel these inefficient garbage bots.
* Generally increasing affordability problems on all fronts while also accelerating the climate disaster that will be central to my sons future.

I wake up every day angry, stressed, and mournful that I am contributing the destruction of my son's future while begrudgingly going to work in the name of his present; in order to keep him clothed, fed, and try to eek out some chance of a better financial future for our family.

I'm not sure how much longer I can keep helping drive the engine of the very destruction I want to put an end to.

There must be some companies out there doing things without AI and making technology choices that are moral. They can't all be sycophants feeding the investor greed machine.. help me find them. I need to know there are some options.

What I mean is saying "we can improve your conversions/revenue by 200%".

But it's risky because when there's no revenue, you just look like a fool.

If someone's best work can increase my 0 euros revenue by 200%, they are saying they can help me get 0 euros. That's not very impressive.

💬 It's funny—when I was building my own video platform, my thinking was along the lines of slicing videos so the encoding jobs could be well-distributed. At the time I was releasing about one video every two months, so it was just about not being patient...

Now I have ~40 videos to re‑encode, and equipped with Terraform, it was easier to spin up a bunch of machines to do it all at once. (Even though with PeerTube you can't parallelize the encoding of a single video for a single target — that's fine)

💬 Восемь высокопроизводительных Python-библиотек в копилку разработчикам

Когда в 1991 году Гвидо ван Россум представил миру Python, никто не мог предсказать, какое место через несколько десятилетий этот язык займет в веб-разработке, Data Science и Machine Learning. Сейчас Python продолжает развиваться: с новым поколением инструментов в прошлое уходят традиционные ограничения — производительность, GIL и сложность параллельных вычислений. Привет, Хабр! С вами Леша Жиряков, я руковожу бэкенд-направлением витрины KION, возглавляю гильдию по Python и пишу для блога MWS на Хабре. Я каждый день сталкиваюсь с вызовами высоконагруженных систем и сформировался пул инструментов, которые помогают решать критические проблемы современной разработки — от обработки данных с Polars до управления зависимостями с UV. В этом материале я сделаю обзор Python-библиотек, с которыми можно создавать системы, сравнимые по производительности с Go и Rust.

Consider these questions when evaluating your linting setup:

- Does this rule prevent actual bugs? If not, consider removing it.
- Would a new team member understand why this rule exists? If you can’t explain it in one sentence, it might be too complex.
- Are we spending more time configuring tools than solving problems? If yes, you’ve gone too far.
- Do our linting rules reflect our team’s actual coding standards? Rules that everyone ignores or works around are worse than no rules. Remember, the best code is code that works, is maintainable, and can be understood by your teammates. If your linting setup supports these goals, great. If it becomes an obstacle to them, it’s time to reassess.

This was a head scratcher to me, and I have been skeptical of Mozilla's intent for a decade or more.

Mozilla's only real paying customer is Google. They don't even list Firefox as a Product in their top nav.

Going to the Products will show you Firefox, but your only option is to download it. You can't pay for it.

VPN and Anonymous email products were never going to make the company sustainable.

I don't know that AI is the answer. What's the business model? But they have to do something.

Then it was One Columbus Circle or the Shops at Columbus Circle.

We've also been using sentry to help PR review. It's really useful for the author's initial review when they verify things before requesting people's time. It does a good job of following database relationships or make sure you do select/prefetch related.

![A color photograph, taken up-close and looking through a dark, grid-patterned metal fence that encloses a windowed view from the elevated train platform at Fordham Road Station in the Bronx. Tar scene is captured on a rainy day. The fence, which fills the foreground, is the sharpest element in the image, with several glistening water droplets clinging to the thick vertical and horizontal wires. This sharp foreground contrasts heavily with the soft, shallow depth of field in the background, which is blurred by the focus. The blurred background shows a street scene below and beyond. The left side features the top of a yellow and blue city bus a red tail light visible. On the right, a row of brick apartment buildings is visible behind a collection of large, brightly colored commercial signs atop stores along the street. The most prominent sign is a long, horizontal one with red, yellow, and blue text. This adds a pop of vibrant, blurry strokes of color to the otherwise muted, overcast palette of greys and browns. The overall mood is cool, damp, and urban.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/115/590/218/712/135/593/original/459e9401ae075e16.jpeg)

💬 Recent discussion about the perils of doors in gamedev reminded me of a bug caused by a door in a game you may have heard of called "Half Life 2". Are you sitting comfortably? Then I shall begin.
