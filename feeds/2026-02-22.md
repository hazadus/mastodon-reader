💬 Building a Nix cache server and faced a classic system design dilemma: chunk compressed data (fast/simple) or decompress first (slow/complex)? 🤔

I tested 60k+ NAR files to find out. 

❌ Compressed: 6.4% dedup hit rate
✅ Uncompressed: 47.8% dedup hit rate

Decompression wins, saving 18% in total storage.

💬 So, I decided to stop offering week-long project courses past my SICP course in June.  All of the LLM madness may have been a catalyst, but honestly, spending the last six years on Zoom post-pandemic was a much bigger factor.   I need to be actively "out and about" more and not spending so much time sitting on the computer.   So, in that sense, I'm mostly feeling a sense of relief about it.

I think I'm still going to do some things (to be determined) with short courses though.

💬 I've had people suggest a return to in-person teaching.   However, I just don't see that as viable.   It's crazy expensive for people to travel and that business model was already pretty precarious before the pandemic (honestly, the only reason I was able to sustain it was because I had my own place which let me control costs).

💬 [@dabeaz](https://mastodon.social/@dabeaz) I’ve found myself on your course page a few times over the years. Travel and cost of that is one thing. Also though, the intensive nature… I get that it’s cool, but the idea I’m gonna have a week free is *unlikely*. Some kind of self-paced, log in to access, with (async) Q&A would be very appealing.

💬 [@carlton](https://chaos.social/@carlton) Something like that might work.   One thing that does *NOT* work in my experience is a live-taught course that meets on a periodic schedule like once a week.    People's natural tendency is to procrastinate (and hey, I'm guilty too) so project progress suffers and you spend too much time reviewing and backtracking.     I tried this once with some courses and kind of hated it.

💬 So, you want me to code in a language that has no formal specification, no test suite, that changes continuously, where builds are not reproducible, where results depend on a hidden state in a build cache that can't be backed up, where I have to pay for each compilation, where I have to continuously send a copy of my code to a third party, and that might disappear with no notice?

💬 i often ask people to only reply to my posts in certain ways (like “please only reply if you find man hard to use”)

It’s because sometimes I get hundreds of replies a day and if folks don’t stay on topic then the replies get so repetitive that it’s hard for me to learn new information.

Really appreciate when people follow the prompts (which most of you do!). I’m posting a reminder because it’s been going a little less well recently than usual

I think model collapse and model draft are different things and are largely avoidable. I admit I don't read whitepapers much, but it's well documented, and there are steps to avoid the issues. So I'm not sure it's inevitable?

I'd like to comment on the common "AI is just a tool" thing: I'm a woodworker by training & that means a lot of machines - but almost every craftsperson knows how to do their job with hand tools, or "lesser" machines. 

Similarly, a writer can write without a text editor - just as well, only slower.

If loss of a tool = loss of your skill & knowledge, then that tool isn't an asset, it's a liability. You're signing over your ability to do business to whoever sells & maintains that tool.

💬 The next Taskmaster UK lineup is absolutely stunning.

Amy Gledhill, Armando Iannucci, Joanna Page, Joel Dommett, Kumail Nanjiani are all so funny people and I can't wait to see what kind of comedic chaos they burst into when brought to the same stage.

If you don't know who they are, Jamie has done once again a wonderful intro to the new lineup in Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65N_cYQeUsM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65N_cYQeUsM)

Open source sustainability isn't just about features; it's about security.

I mean, it's like worrying about the end of the universe, not much we can do until it happens, but everything I've seen is that unless there is a big change in LLM architecture (likely, though we don't know what) it's hard to avoid model collapse at some point soonish. Anyhoo. I'll use the tools until then. Not much action we can take.

I have't read them all, but I have skimmed dozens (I honestly lost track) of papers which break it down to this: 

tl;dr "Our findings extend these prior works to show that if data accumulates and models train on a mixture of “real” and synthetic data, model collapse no longer occurs." 

Here are a few to check out:

[#NYC](https://typo.social/tags/NYC) [#Photography](https://typo.social/tags/Photography) [#SilentSunday](https://typo.social/tags/SilentSunday)

![A color, medium-angle photograph in square aspect ratio that captures a dimly lit, moody interior corner of the underground pedestrian passageway at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. The scene is dominated by dark, polished granite walls that meet at a sharp corner, with a staircase visible on the right side leading upward to the street level. In the center of the frame, a solitary yellow "Caution: Wet Floor" sign stands on the dark flooring, illuminated by four recessed circular lights in the white ceiling. The lighting creates a dramatic contrast, casting deep shadows in the corners while highlighting the texture of the stone and a silver metal handrail along the stairs. At the top of the frame, a prominent Art Deco-style sign hangs from the ceiling. The sign consists of two black horizontal tiers with gold-toned trim; the upper tier reads "50th STREET" and the lower tier reads "AVENUE of the AMERICAS" in clean, white capital letters. To the left, a brass plaque is mounted on the wall, partially caught in a warm glow from an unseen light source behind the sign.](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/cache/media_attachments/files/116/116/057/109/456/077/original/d6709d53f023c5f4.jpeg)

💬 Release: queryfy v0.3.0

Queryfy is a Go library for working with map[string]interface{} data. It provides schema validation, path-based querying, and data transformation in a single package — designed for JSON APIs, configuration files, and any scenario where data arrives as untyped maps rather than structs.

Repo:

[https://github.com/ha1tch/queryfy#readme](https://github.com/ha1tch/queryfy#readme)

Eight months in the making, this is a substantial update that brings queryfy up to date with its expected roadmap, and then some: we are getting in 0.3.0 JSON Schema features that were expected to arrive later in 0.4.0

New: MANUAL.md

[https://github.com/ha1tch/queryfy/blob/main/MANUAL.md](https://github.com/ha1tch/queryfy/blob/main/MANUAL.md)

Highlights

% Schema introspection
% Schema equality and hashing
% Schema diff
% Schema compilation

% JSON Schema import
% JSON Schema export
% Wildcard queries
% Iteration methods
% Enhanced Transform api

% Async validation
% 80%+ test coverage, and better across all packages

Changelog:
